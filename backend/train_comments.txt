Lex, ask your dad about exotic plasmas from space, sprites and cosmic ray collisions with atmosphere.,(reply>), @Pinnedby Lex Fridman..  i sent an email to your dad a few years back and if he received it I don‚Äôt know. No reply anyways. Here it is. <br>Dear Alexander,<br><br>As earth plies its‚Äô path through the solar system, several tons of all varieties of matter are donated in meteorites, daily. My question is, what amount of these meteorites become plasma balls and if so how long do they last? Can they transition from hot to cold and stay intact?  Can a plasma ball be attracted or repelled by an airplane or its‚Äô avionics? Are plasma balls detectable on radar or could appear to be trying to jam radar because of the nature of plasma itself? Could plasma balls be moved in the atmosphere by creating a vacuum in a space next to the plasma ball? <br>Could reports UAP‚Äôs have hovered over missile silos be radioactive isotopes in the radioactive plasma of a uranium meteorite that has a quantum affinity for some atoms in a missle warhead?<br>Could EM beams from satellites influence trajectories of plasma balls?<br><br>I‚Äôm 62 and love Physics and can‚Äôt do the time to research such questions, so I reach out to your vast knowledge and ask if these are questions with answers or questions in need of answering. <br><br>Also, <br>Plasma Tunnel Boring and Plasma Tunnel Printing machine, combined. <br>Can such a machine be theoretically workable? Use the tunnel bore material to print the tunnel?<br><br>I hope you had a laugh if not a ponder and maybe a bud from me may bloom into an idea someone else has patented already. <br>I love the Universe because it is so bouncy bouncy and everything is waving at everything else. <br>Ross Kirkwood, Squamish BC,(reply>), Appreciate your time,<br>I‚Äôd share a beneficial knowledge<br>‚úéüí¨¬±ùü∑ùü∏ùü∂ùü∑ùüøùüæùüΩùüπùüºùüæùüæ

Can someone tell me what I have stumbled upon? Like just a general explanation on what I‚Äôve just watched,(reply>), In Python, a programing language, there were two very similar operators.<br>"=" which could assign a value to a variable;<br>and "==" which could tell you if a variable was equal to another variable or value, by returning "true" if they're equal or "false" if they're not.<br>Although very simmilar in syntax, their functionalities were very different, meaning that if one were to mistype, and use one in place of the other, the compiler would throw you an error, showing you that you, the programmer, screwed up, you could then easily correct your mistake.<br><br>BUT In other programming languages like C the "=" operator would not only assign a value to a variable but also return the value assigned, this way, you could write code like this:<br>"If (variable = true){<br>//DO THINGS//<br>}" <br>in this case you would assign "true" to a variable, but also return "true" to the "IF" statement, that would execute its functions //DO THINGS// if whatever is inside the parenthesis returned "true";<br><br>You couldn't do such thing in python, since "=" would not return "true" in python, and as such, not making any fking sense. So, they added the ":=" operator, that would function like the "=" in C, returning the value assigned to whatever the programmer intended. The problem is that this leaves python with THREE operators that represent "equality" ("==", "=" and ":=") AKA very confusing for begginers. <br>Some people believe they should've just used the "=" operator like in C but that can be prone to errors. If you were to mistype<br> "IF(variable == true)"<br> for <br>"IF (variable = true)"<br>The compiler would accept it as a valid line of code, while previously it wouldn't.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Or something like this.

This dudes got nice hair
I got a 10/12 and a 12/12 on the SAT essay portion (the very brief time they had it at least when I was in HS 06-08) but colleges didn't take that into consideration whatsoever. I had a diagnosed math learning disability but I guess Neuro diversity didn't matter in the ancient PC age.  I scored very low in the "moderate" range, I wouldn't say it was a rock bottom score, of the math portion, I scored high on the lower-end of reading portion. I didn't get accepted into a state college even. Definitely got snubbed by my small pretentious first choice. I only got accepted at some small rural college just to keep my options open but the folks I met on tour didn't sell me whatsoever like they knew it was the last choice but only accepting school. I didn't want to be at the top of the reject pile from other schools (at best). So I just attended community college for the remedial math and it actually DID help me solidify basic to medium highschool level algebra, I even scored high As in those classes, I never ever thought I'd EVER score a 96-100% on a math exam PERIOD let alone the dreaded algebra (geometry was ok, I managed to get Bs and Cs, there was this write off "vocational maths" class they offered in lieu of pre-cal for seniors but the teacher was just so inexperienced, ignorant of the taught subject and convoluted scoring method that technically FAILED MOST OF THE CLASS but I don't recall how it was resolved but I think it involved everyone getting at least a C grade, or one grade above what they got, on their official transcript due to mass parental and student outrage since it was a private school charging 15k a year for DAY students and 28k for boarders in freakin 2008... It was also an exclusively female student body, so of course there'll already be a lower proportion of effortlessly strong math students.<br><br>I feel like I was always written off as slow or incapable, even in my academic strengths that surpassed many AG students, bc of my math LD. I was prohibited from being in both a remedial and AG class simultaneously but that could be from scheduling limitations, to be fair. I was in "regular" reading class bc I think the social studies and sciences only had the non-AG and AG categories in middle school. My private highschool was default honors classes so.... Anyways. Every IQ test I've taken that doesn't use academic math, I score around 120-135 but if it involves solving math problems, forget it, I'm lucky to score average. I FULLY APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY AND EXISTENCE IF MATH lol but I feel like a lot of exclusively math LDer, not general LDs but even they can posses above average IQs but I think it's less common if you lack expressive and receptive written language skills, are almost discriminated against based on disability bc they aren't taught in a way that would allow them to learn and retain the skill. I'm not expecting lower standards, just accomodations like small group classes, with a TA to help individual students. I pulled chemistry from a PITY D first semester to a solid B by the second from 6-8 hrs of private tutoring with a bio grad, which is organic chemistry pretty much, student (they can teach basic chemistry obviously) who was AMAZING at it. She also helped get me into addiction treatment after graduation, long story there... I was lucky enough to have parents who could afford all this personalized assistance. If I grew up in poverty, yeah forget it, I could have easily been a highschool dropout.<br><br>My mom is a general practice MD (who spent countless late nights vigilantly proof reading and helping me strengthen my academic and "argumentative" writing skills, and maybe taking over some very micro bits to put that flair on it when I was fried and over her perfectionism lol, but have her to thank for my expressive  and receptive language abilities as she also read to me nightly as a child, my dad is a state funded human services provider founder/CEO who was a mechanical engineering major and worked in the field for a decade before that. Inarguably my privileged background explains my success against the odds without the charity of others to help me along the public school track. I did go public before highschool.,(reply>), Tell your mom to help you with brevity.

I can never get behind diversity over talent and work ethic when it comes to hiring. I mean, sure diversity is always good, but being able to do a good job should always take precedence. Being a certain race have nothing to do with that.

I wonder, if someone stole such penny from, say, there, and got caught, would they face punishment for, er, not familiar with British legal stuff, large larceny, because it could be worth 100 000 squids, or, small larceny, because it's face value is, a penny...

Beware of human values, they can be barbaric. It is centered around individual, family, group, nation. It does not  accept the responsibility of poverty, sufferings, misery of the other people but blame them instead.,(reply>), vallab In many respects isn‚Äôt the evolution of the ideas of individual, family, group, and nation are the acceptance of responsibility for poverty, suffering, and misery of other people within these groups as well as within the individual? These ideas help to eliminate some suffering. Also, suffering is inescapable. At best humans try to minimize it.
I work in that city as a QA tester. I can tell you that QA, especially QA game testers are the bottom of the barrel of IT (McDonald's salary, though you work at a desk), so most people don't stay for long and leave in droves. Of course it's not the same people that tested The Witcher 3, but inexperienced youngsters, fresh out of college with a worthless degree (sometimes not even a finished college, yes I am also projecting here, lol). Luckily I worked as QA tester for a 1st party company, the testers were pretty much all good and experienced and the company stopped hiring new people, so a lot of testers with 5+ years of experience remained. The projects were also much smaller. However I heard about Quantic Lab and their shitty practices, it's sad.
Fascinating conversation just as our üß† is! Thanks Lex!

For me, and I work in IT so I understand I might not have the most common perspective here, I would much rather a progress bar indicate that it is working, and, ideally, why it's hanging.  I have done installs, where it gets to 83% then hangs for THIRTY+ minutes, then installs fine.  I've also done similar installs where it seems to be going fine and then hangs for 2 weeks... knowing what specifically it's working on, or was about to be working on, makes it WAY easier to make the call on whether or not it's actually completing or not, even if you normally hide that data behind, say, a little drop down arrow.

There were a lot of good parts but I‚Äôm disappointed that Lex barely made an attempt to ask questions about the negative aspects of Instagram. As Systrom himself said of the recent Facebook stuff, this is not new information! Instagram‚Äôs addictive qualities are a feature, not a bug? Other questions could‚Äôve been ‚ÄúHow do you feel about empowering the shallowest people in the world to make huge amounts of money?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWould the world be a better place without Instagram.‚Äù Lex went into fanboy mode hard and didn‚Äôt display deep inquisitiveness that I love about him!,(reply>), ‚Äã@Wouter Post Ya! I think it's very possible that Lex does not know a single "normal" person and doesn't realize how big of a roll Instagram plays in many people's lives. It's tough to suggest to someone that the thing they devoted their life to is actually terrible but I think genuine scientific thinking would force you to at least ponder that idea.,(reply>), I would more than agree with you here.<br><br>I did not watch this podcast even partially since I read your comment, and supposed based on your comment that if what you say is true (and I think chances thereof are gargantuan) , watching the podcast would hurt me immensely.<br><br>I would, indeed considering your assessment on Lex' questions to be valid, suppose the conversation is Fridman's worst 'performance' hitherto, although I must admit I appreciated some of his previous podcasts and think his thinking there was rather specially profound. <br><br>This podcast, from your simple sketch of its content, would supposedly inter alia (alia being a plethora of cultural deformative processes) be leaving undiscussed the moronic culture which the structure of Instagram has for the last few years been solidifying amongst especially the very young, but accross American and international culture, shattering the sensibility of the world populace.<br><br>There is so much to say about these Bernaysian, Macluhanesque, Debordian issues at hand that I am aghast by Fridman's lack of putting those under his scrutiny. It would require a lot of time and energy to explain what exactly these are (some readers and viewers here may understand or agree) and it is extremely psychologically painful on countless levels that Lex should have done at least exactly that, and did not, particularly because he is considered (I suppose from a, regarding that assumption, relatively low-information position in Europe) an intellectual bastion, a leading figure in the meta-reflective posse of Silicon Valley and if even he does not grasp these basics I think that would be ominous for future developments coming from the valley's cradle (or is that tautological?). By all means, someone (perhaps Lex himself? since maybe he is just playing with his viewers  after all with this then joke of an interview and is no fool, or is he?) should make a podcast considering all that. I certainly would make it, if I had the time-energy expenditure position to do so, and while unfortunately I don't have that, perhaps someone else (Lex, are you there?) should. <br><br>But in sum, Silicon Valley hubris appears increasingly horrid considering this rendition of Lex' podcast.<br><br>Cheers to all involved anyway, hope we'll see some interesting perspectives on this issue soon (before it's too late, or is it?)!,(reply>), Here. Also immensely dissapointed with Lex lately. He's been kissing a lot of corporate asses.

big question for me is:  are public health decisions best made by public health officials?  i feel from my experience, public officials are too arrogant and cannot think outside the box.  non-medical processes can interact with medical decisions (crime, schools, parenting, etc) that doctors don't even consider as relevant, and affect the effects

There are 2 faces of islam, 1 which it shows to the whole world as a peaceful religion and other what it  actually is, a religion which does not give men and women equal opportunity, which believe that allah is the supreme god and those who challenges it should be killed, a religion which allows men to have 4 wives but women can't have 4 husbands, a religion which says that the human creation is a perfect creation of allah and yet they circumcise a baby, a religion in  which you only have 3 options according to shariah that is to either convert, pay jasiya or get ready to die. Islam calls it a just system. They seek refuge from their country to another and tries to impose the same culture which led them to to refuge in that country. <br>I can do this all day, but the point is to not get trapped by their words and theaters.,(reply>), @Shyff Speaking the truth is not Islamophobia, whatever I have written above are from quran, hadis and muslim practices. Is it not true that in islam a woman's testimony is only considered half. Is it not true that Mohammed married a 6 year old and slept with him when she was 9 years of age. Is it not true that Mohammed forgives a men for killing his wife because she was abusing Mohammed. Is it not true that Mohammed and sahabis made sex slaves, which they than sell to others. <br>Either you don't know anything or you are like the rest of ostriches.,(reply>), @King I have, you‚Äôre not answering the question tho, but only spewing out the different stereotypes you hear in the media &amp; from islamophobes. I can‚Äôt possibly conceive that this is what you came up with after actually reading the word of Allah &amp; the hadith, but I hope your ignorance in this topic encourages you to do so &amp; actually learn something.

The ferry from Vancouver Island to Vancouver BC Canada had a type of progress bar to let car drivers know how they would have to wait. Particularly on a Sunday afternoon in the summer the ferries would be very busy. If you were lucky when you stopped in the queue you might see a sign saying "one Ferry". Going back it would be "two Ferries", "three Ferries" then if you were very late the signs would say "Tomorrow".

It is something very hard to cover and dive into. Like it is easy to underestimate how taxing on your metal health surrounding your self in for a lack of better terms the Evils of the world can be. There is a reason special victim units tend to have high suicide rates(even among cops) as well as low retirement requirements and transfers. Take the time you need to recover, it is a requirement when deep diving into these topics and events.

Lex, <br>You are on the right path. Your ideas about alternate ways those advanced civilizations may use to communicate with each other is a spot on. They don't use radios. They simply can't. EMW are too slow even for communications inside of our Solar system. This is why all of those SETI (Silly Efforts To Investigate - Stanton Friedman) efforts are doomed. <br>Talking about Drake's equation - he doesn't take in account the fact that advanced civilizations spur to other planets inside and outside of their star systems and establish colonies. As a matter of fact, we are one of them.<br>As per my sources, there are 700+ discovered intelligent civilizations / colonies in a Milky Way alone with at least one known interstellar / interplanetary union.<br>Keep digging this subject and your "IF" and "MAY BE" will become solid "IS".

They should just remover all the silly math behind DPS and and have it where it's just bullet damage over one mag being emptied. Ignore all talents from DPS rather than some do some don't.

I think it likely that alien life will be derived from and consist of microbial organisms. Much as the life on this planet does. At that level there is sufficient diversity to colonise almost any environment. Furthermore, I suspect they travel better, and must be candidates for panspermia. It might be quicker for an advanced civilisation to distribute microbial life across the galaxy than themselves. Maybe they are here already?

Then when I see her jump off a 20m platform it looks way higher than I thought it would.,(reply>), Yup, this makes safety stops and such <i>feel</i> much more acute and sensible, hahaha,(reply>), @AndyGneiss Pressure increases by about 1 atmosphere per 10 metres, so at 18 metres, you're at almost 3 atmospheres, including the 1 atm from the actual atmosphere. I've only been to 10m myself, and it feels shallow. I don't imagine 18 metres feels all that deep either. It's once you stop being able to see the sun things get scary.,(reply>), And water is so much heavier than air.  Diving really puts that into perspective when you see how compressed the bubbles are deep down.,(reply>), @Daniel Dekker It's definitely quite a lot of water above your body when you are that deep.,(reply>), What a great point!

If we take teleportation to space as an example, isn't the whole point that you don't have to push through the gravity well, and use energy? If you could teleport from one end of a swimming pool to another, you wouldn't have to exert the force of swimming the length of the pool?<br><br>Superpowers are kinda magic, it may require energy in real life to fly, turn invisible or punch through solid steel, but the whole point is that it takes considerably less energy for the person with the power to do this.

Which one of those classifications does German fall into? I have never studied German, but I know there are lots of long words,(reply>), German is a fusional language. E.g. verbs are formed (conjugated) similar to the way explained with the habl-o in Spanish.,(reply>), +Adam Johnson I'd guess more isolating than English. There are long words but those are substantives chained together and do not convey grammar. Also they're rarely used. German doesn't have contractions like "I'd" "He's" "they're" "wouldn't" etc. , that's why I'd put it more on the isolating side of the spectrum.

Ok," that's cool. But here's how to bake a cake: <br><br>STEP 1<br>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4"," butter and line the base of two 20cm spring-form cake tins with baking parchment.<br><br>STEP 2<br>Using an electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Crack the eggs in one at a time and whisk well", scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the lemon zest, vanilla, flour, milk and a pinch of salt. Whisk until just combined then divide the mixture between the two tins.<br><br>STEP 3<br><br>Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. After 10 mins remove the cakes from their tins and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Fill how you like. My personal favourite is a good dollop of lemon curd and some fresh cream, then dust the top with icing sugar. Will keep for 3 days.<br><br>Have fun!

transhumanism just modify your DNA to repair it,(reply>), Mark Williams You would have to regrow your ear muscle with the changed DNA, and we already have DNA that allows for that range of hearing.

Given how the design works, there doesn't seem to be a significant reason to have the entire pipe rotate. It's really the scoops at the bottom that are applying the majority of the workload. They're effectively like the blades of a turbine, with the whole screw acting as a stator.,(reply>), I guess the advantage of the rotating pipe is that you won't have shearing force against the inside wall as the material rises, thus lowering damage to whatever material you're lifting, which wouldn't be the case if the pipe didn't rotate or if you were rotating only the screw.

"about 30.33m away" - the sort facts we like to heare on this channel.,(reply>), @Julian Schanze I always round stuff like that to the nearest somewhat big number. Very very rarely it is relevant whether a distance guess like this is 30, 30.38 or 31 meters.,(reply>), Let's also remember that 100 ft are 30.48m... so 30.33 just seems like way too many significant digits...,(reply>), I've noticed that a lot of people do that with unit conversions.  It's ok to spitball a guess in Imperial, usually to a nice round number, but you'd better get that metric conversion of that guess right to at least six significant digits.,(reply>), I identified with that, my terrace house in Melbourne is built on a 16 x 100 foot block of land. But no one aged under 60 understands what that means, so I just say it's 5 x 30 1/3 metres.,(reply>), @olli1886 Wide angle lenses and perspectives are always interesting

yeah..... when I was seeing everything play out, I was thinking of seeing the same thing in various developing countries... this type of thing doesnt happen in America until now....,(reply>), its happened a lot of times, read  American History...... we had a Civil war, hell in the 20s,30s, 40s, and 60s, we had 10 times the political turmoil we do today..

aw, Tom, this is so cool that you came here just to confront a possible little hoax :D
First...?
Tom you should have done the math to determine how many cars will need to stay connected to the grid. If the wind farm has a 150 Mw potential, how much does it actually produce? Since the fuel based power plants have to stay online to cover the wind generated shortfall how much CO2 production has been  diminished?
Less interesting than a coin with a face value of 100K. Like a Trillion Dollar Bill.
i doubt this will ever see production. too damn expensive. is this why thyssen are "on their arse" ?

I can think of 30-40 games that would meet the "standard A".

Worth a try; it's a game based on Inuit folklore.

If you by some chance still read your comments i would like to turn your attention to the way you act in your video. Please stop acting so robotic and scripted it is (at the least for me) so painful to watch, the way you take a breath the way you stop talking abruptly, how you push your arms and body when you finish a sentence to give it more "umph" how you speed up your talking when you have a long sentence to finish and how you announce every word at end of a sentence, it feels like you're not reading the script but that you ARE the scrip, you've trained so much on reading your scrip and following every .!"

Not an expert but why it makes a lot of sense: you can have a lot of different sensors and do lots of test for different pollutants. But to do test, you need to know what to look for. if one day, water will get contaminated with an unknown substance, that is harmfull towards living creatures, clamps will still get hurt. <br>Only hope that those clamps react to a big spcetrum of pollutants and if, for example, some terrorist state tries to poison water supplies, clamps wont get outsmarted that easily.

I‚Äôm in the laptop group generally unaffected in the last 2 years. I‚Äôm all for being inconvenienced to help protect others, but so much of the actions led by our government has been so wrong. It is possible to analyze the impacts of policies and identify the policies which have the least impact overall and protects the most people. It is clear that the policies followed were not effective in the USA. This is the first sensible discussion I‚Äôve heard in the last 2 years.

Reminds me of a story my dad told me, he used to work in the old telephone exchanges in the 1950's and 1960's as a technicians. They had HUUGE flywheels spinning in the basement of the exchanges 24/7, and in the event of a power failure some of the technicians would have to run down to the basement and slowly release complicated sets of clutches so the flywheels could start massive generators.

Yet the top selling games of last month were, Red Dead, Call of Duty, Battlefield 5 and Fallout 76. The entire stock market is down, so looking just at EA is meaningless.

We have DIsney to blame for alot of this sentiment from company's, Disney where poisoners in expanding copyright laws for old content about to become public domain and that began a spiral of expansion and a whole lot of "Disney vault like situations" where things are left to rott and be forgotten just for the slight chance they can make some money or to own IP's for eternity.

Lex, could you try to interview Grigori Perelman - the man who refused one million dollar prize for proving Poincar√© conjecture?

Tips for when visiting Iceland:<br><br>No. 1 - don't leave your raincoats in the boot of the car at the airport in Glasgow. It will rain all day, every day, and the cost of a replacement rain coat will take up about 60% of your budget.<br><br>No. 2 - definitely visit the Blue Lagoon.,(reply>), @Petra Mar√≠a R√∂gnvaldsd√≥ttir Definitely do not buy water! The tap water is just about the best I've ever tasted.<br><br>We were very unlucky I think. It didn't stop raining for a minute. The raincoats we bought were ridiculous though. More kagoul than raincoat, one size only.  I'm 5'4" and skinny. Husband is 6'2" and quite muscular. His was too small (very short in the arms) and mine was too big, knee length dress style and I had to fold the sleeves up which made it a lot less waterproof. Not that they actually kept much water out anyway.<br><br>The really sad thing is, we'd spent the previous week travelling around Scotland and .... it didn't stop raining.  <br><br>Both parts of the holiday were fantastic.,(reply>), Charlienmeg no.3 do not buy water<br><br>Also, it does not always rain, you were just unlucky xD

I find war to be illogical. Are the catastrophic effects of nuclear really worth it? For someone so cynical and power-hungry, that's millions of lives lost and our habitat destroyed. The fact that nuclear is even an option is absurd to me.

I always what exactly that noise was, in High School I could here that halfway down the hall in a concrete building.  It drove me up the wall.  I would enter the classroom and ask the teacher to turn of the monitor, when they would ask why and I would tell him the rest of the students strained and could hear it.  A lot of people thought I was hearing things or it was birds.  Also the noise you played as the monitors was way off, not sure if you made it deeper for others to hear or not, or just the way the audio picked it up.
The ending was just-<br>I can't.

Just print log of what's going on to help the user reassure that something is going on
I'm afraid you are so badly wrong and the "system" we exist in, is a multiverse, and that multiverse is infinite... Just because you can not prove it, does not mean it isn't there... We do have members of other interplanetary civilisations visiting us, but their intelligence level is so advanced that they see us as an interesting ant, no need to worry about aliens killing us as there are better planets that are uninhabited out there for there building resources, scientific programmes and individual desires... So you should work on that basis and not just our Galaxy... You should also work on the alien systems invented by these civilisations, which includes the travel mechanics enabling the exitance of a multiverse traveller and their craft... BUT...‚Ä¶ As we know, a multiverse "well anything is possible there isn't it due to the size of infinity and the number of civilisations existing?"..... Plus evolution also needs technology for advancement which includes humans becoming androids or a "good Borg species"..

I am a programmer. Everything you said is reasonable and I understand it. But I do not understand how Macbooks. Which are very limited in their hardware configurations cannot tell me, even close, how long a pre downloaded system update will take. It is updating it self and Apple has millions of identical machines they could tell very accurately how long it will take but it still is way off everytime.
Does the tapwater there still counts as vegan?
I have little knowledge of crypto, but got interested the last few weeks, might buy some, but I‚Äôm always the ‚Äúlet me mull this over some more and research still more.‚Äù Not interested in a quick profit, more interested in being part of something truly ground-breaking. One thing highly attractive is the way some crypto can open opportunity pathways in undeveloped nations, especially in Africa. My wife came from Africa, the corruption and lack of standards severely depresses those economies, would like to be part of making capital available in that space, even if it‚Äôs at a small level. ‚Ä¶..Close to buying in.

Suffering is one of my favorite subjects to research. It will always make you realize that no matter how bad you think your situation is others have it far worse. Be grateful for what you have guys. It can all be gone in the blink of an eye. And please give back when you can. Thank you Lex for this episode, for shaping our perspective of true suffering.,(reply>), Yes you are totally right. This podcast came at the perfect time. I have been mentally in the dumps but this made me feel better by being grateful for everything I have.

Riley, I love you, and I'mma let you finish, but OnePlus enjoyed years of love in the tech community simply for keeping the headphone jack when Apple ditched it. If OnePlus decides to ditch the headphone jack now, you can't blame Apple more than you blame OnePlus. In this matter, Apple gets all the blame when it was Apple who released AirPods, a product truly better than wired headphones. You can't claim that Apple in particular has to keep the headphone jack around so you can use wired headphones on a product they don't make, such as Android phones.

The token agenda awards. Where if you aren't actively an activist for what they want you and your game don't matter. This is sadly what mainstream media surrounding a lot of entertainment industries is these days. The things they cover don't matter, only how much those things suck the metaphorical dick of their cause.<br><br>But honestly I really feel tokenism is more damaging to minorities than anything. It strips the person of their personhood and makes them a statistic that is added to be praised for how progressive it is to do so.

I heard about similar methods decades ago in Germany. It was some species of fish, which are very sensitive to pollutants. Especially in the old days, before we had high tech sensors, this was a very valuable method to control the water quality.<br>Using animals as sensors is a very old procedure - we all have heard of the canary in the coal mine. Thats just the same kind of method to detect danger.,(reply>), Probably trout.,(reply>), Oh, thank you for the reminder of the famous canaries!,(reply>), it's still being used,(reply>), There was (is?) a bio watch system with fish in a cooperation between Germany and The Netherlands at the Rhine with a prepared ship which had fish onboard to monitor the pollution of the Rhine. It wasn't for drinking water but pollution in common. Of course, alarms were sent to drinking water companies with intake of the river is pollution was found.

Great guest and interview. It all comes down to what he said ‚Ä¶‚ÄúComputers ‚Ä¶ a magical extension of your mind‚ÄùComputer-Magical-Extension-Mind. If the Universe is a computer it must already have been and IS ‚Ä¶ a living conscious computer How do we know ? ‚Ä¶ WE ARE HERE ‚Ä¶ That is all the proof one needs. <br><br>I love science. However, science can‚Äôt even see this fact, or ask questions from that obvious and true perspective. <br><br>This tells one all one needs to know about why physics is at a particle chasing road block and biology and computer science aren‚Äôt. <br><br>Science‚Äôs biggest blind spot/assumption, is  - ‚Äúenergy is dead and unconscious‚Äù <br><br>For this to be true, there would have to be a lab somewhere with a sample of dead energy üß™<br><br>Ask yourself ‚Ä¶. what would that even mean in the context of ‚Ä¶ Energy IS The Universe. IS all that is was and will be ‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not even a theory ‚Ä¶ it is literally what Universe MEANS. <br><br>How can we have the quality of life and consciousness ‚Ä¶ and yet these qualities are not seen as qualities of the one entangled holographic field as a whole. <br><br>That is the madness of materialism. Science wedded to the belief system of militant materialism. <br><br>Proof ? Science cannot frame big bang plasma energy as being alive and conscious ‚Ä¶ even in potential. Yet ‚Ä¶ not to see this is to deny cause and effect , systems theory, holism the fact that the Universe and our bodies (nested cellular community) are nested holons all the way up and all the way down. <br><br>The holon above is an environment for the holon below. Yes ‚Ä¶. science doesn‚Äôt even go there. Children leave school indoctrinated into atomism and materialism. <br><br>Proof? Throughout my whole school science education not one teacher mentioned the mysteries and the unanswered questions itemised above in the way I have framed them. I had to discover the living conscious non billiard ball universe through my own investigations. <br><br>No wonder kids don‚Äôt go into science. They don‚Äôt want to spend time with people so convinced that we live in a dead meaningless unconscious Universe.
hot damn this was a good episode, Riley should totally do tech news stand up at a coffee shop

Society has no issue accepting that there are numerous genetic/chromosomal abnormalities that result in severe and lifelong mental disabilities, but somehow, everyone elses' intelligence is completely divorced from genetics and a 'blank slate'. Give me a break.

I heard the high pitched morse code at the end, and both my cats reacted to it too :P
Life is literally antithetical to entropy because it builds increased complexity whilst the universe is marching towards simplicity. We are basically defying entropy (by using energy) in order to exist‚Ä¶ we started eating sunlight, and then other creatures, and then capturing other energy forms‚Ä¶ and we will continue this for millions of years until we invent methods of harnessing energy from dimensions and maybe other universes too. The heat death of the universe may be avoided.
ü§î what about using a different wavelength/a phase shift to cause interference which would appear as pulses? Probably would require very high precision but is it possible?

Intel can charge more for less because they are Intel.  They have thousands of years of experience and I don't think they have ever released unreliable server CPUs.

And the advertisement before this loaded was Anthem lol is anyone really going to go near that game with less than a 10ft barge pole. <br><br>I loved the division 1, weren't sure about the division 2, but it's gotten a ton of praise across the board already, so ordered the collectors edition (which amazingly is only ¬£80) it came with 2 DLC packs, art book, map etc. And a quite big and well detailed figurine. Resident evil 2's collectors edition on the other hand was a disgusting ¬£250. I've yet to actually try the game but looking forward to it.
It's funny that i hear "first time nuclear fusion experiment produced more energy than it required" every few years. Did a quick google search and there are numerous articles claiming it, even one from 2014. Though that experiment had less margin (the newest one was around 20% more output than input, the 2014 one was much smaller increase), it still was technically more output than input-so the new one is not 'the first time'. And there were others every few years claiming the same.
This felt like one big ad
I did something similar but used Striker instead of Lonestar with Assault rifles. It wrecks.

I disagree with this being a bad move on Gamestop, with the whole GPU thing. They know GPUs are scarce right now. They know they will have a hard time coming across GPUs, for right now. Once this crypto bubble burst again, the crypto miners are going to liquidate their stock as fast as possible, but it's not easy just selling it on eBay, you need bubble wrap, boxes, ect. And on top of that you have eBay and Paypal fees. It would be faster and cheaper to just go to the local Gamestop and just sell them all in bulk. Boom! A tsunami of used GPUs back on the market and no need to wait for manufactures!, This is a big brain move on Gamestop, playing the long game. Diamond hands üôåüíé!

This is a huge problem with small community fandoms: a small creator will make art/music/fanfic, then years later it will get deleted for unknown reasons.  Maybe the author isn't proud of it anymore, or the account got hacked, or they got DMCA'd.  Then it's gone.  Maybe someone with a copy will reupload it, if they notice.  But more likely, especially with small fandoms, it's gone forever.

The first time a friend told me about it, I thought it was a joke. When I found out that it was not a joke and an actual movie, I was sickened. This is nothing more than softcore porn for pedophiles.

<i>"NYC Bans Students and Teachers from using ChatGPT"</i> Yeah, good luck with that, Luddites. That's like trying to ban students from using a calculator on their maths homework.,(reply>), @Duc Pham im just glad if everyone from kindergarten can read and write. even that's an achievement in many top-tier western world countries. still not everyone does in Finland for example, and it was #1 in Pisa scores a few years back.<br><br>we still have people that go through basic mandatory education without learning to properly read and write. and we were #1 in Pisa score in 2020.<br><br> "calculator is ..to help them understand concepts"<br>uh, a calculator does not help you understand concepts, it just makes you type things, by the way. you can totally just mechanically type into a calculator without understanding anything, that's how I did my math. <br>just follow an example, and mechanically type the formula and it gave me an answer. I didn't understand anything.<br><br>it's not like if you have more homework the more you automatically understand the subject. Finland is famous for not having a lot of homework, and 15-minute recesses every 45 minutes because that's scientifically the maximum children can concentrate on a subject. versus someplace like Spain, where kids don't get out the whole day, the volume is loud, and one of the worst Pisa scores in eu.<br><br>if you don't get it, it doesn't help that you are just given more homework on the material you don't understand! all he or she will do is mechanically copy and paste the same formulaic answer, like in math, without understanding why he or she is doing it, what's happening. <br>You don't understand the concept of homework.<br> it's not meant to punish the children for not knowing, so he or she goes home and fills in the asked questions by googling answers.<br>because she never understood it when it was taught, he or she still doesn't get it.<br>so you have another day with homework full of right answers... and low pisa scores overall in the nation.<br><br>I used Grammarly to automatically fix all my typos in a few seconds.<br>if I checked it manually, it would've taken me probably 30 minutes or more.,(reply>), Okay, should we allow kindergarten students to use calculators to calculate 1 + 1 = 2? don't you see that it is clearly pointless to test their basic arithmetic skills if allowing them to use a calculator ?. In other situations, allowing them to use a calculator is not meant to measure their calculation abilities, but rather to help them understand concepts such as definitions, formulas, and problem-solving techniques. You probably don't understand what the point of doing homework is. 40 likes? people here are more stupid than I imagine.,(reply>), Remember the days when teachers tried to do this,(reply>), Eventually someone will realize education and testing needs to change dramatically... or we can just have everyone getting A's without knowing anything. Up to them.

I LOVE your reaction to the loop! Do you usually say "oh boy" or were you trying not to swear?<br>I love gliders.
The mark of someone who's truly confident in themselves is their ability to lay it all out in the open. A lesser coach would try to hide and obfuscate tactics and ideas.  I think this is true far beyond the world of Jiu-Jitsu or even coaching. Good ideas survive and even thrive under scrutiny. Yes maybe one day someone will take what John is teaching and improve upon it to the point that they can beat John's fighters, but John doesn't fear that day, it'll mean that he gets another opportunity to learn and grow and change his perspective.<br><br>Also it should be noted how he takes blame for Garry Tonon's loss, but attributes Gordon and Giancarlo's successes to their hard work and dedication. This is the attitude that distinguishes great teachers and great leaders from the rest.

Epic doesn't have to have it on the google play store why dont they just put it on android as an apk,(reply>), They did. For over a year, that was the only way to get Fortnite on Android because Epic wanted to avoid the costs associated with the Play Store. Fortnite eventually did come to the Store but only earlier this year. The issue Epic have with the apk option is that Google put technical hurdles in place that disadvantage apps that are distributed outside the Play Store.

Yo with this Sony censorship shit going on right now, im scared something will happen to Cyberpunk,(reply>), I'm not. Nothing will happen to Cyberpunk 2077. Something will happen to the PS4/5 version if CP77, but that's an inferior version for weak hardware, anyway. Even if Sony won't force CDPR to kiddify the PS versions (and, let's face it, they likely will), I'd rather play the game with K&amp;M, with very high (probably maxed) details at 2160@60, not something with half the effects missing, on some weird resolution that's neither here nor there, with 30 fps.

the big problem with driverless cars is who is to blame in an accident, the person behind thd wheel?  the car manufacturer? the company who makes the sensors or computer?  they like to have someone to blame and in the uk insurance companies are very jittery about driverless vehicles.  mercedes benz have now said their systems in  driverless trucks they are testing will only be a driver aid and a driver will have to be behind the wheel to take over in an emergency.
Google does support Pixel phones for that long. Wow. It's 3 years of major updates and 5-6 security updates. It's not bad considering new iOS on old iPhones are dumbed down versions with features turned off. Apple and Google also take different approaches to what their versions are. It's nice having newer iOS, but anything really new and not a security update can just be downloaded from the Play Store, there's tons of launchers and apps and no need to wait for Apple to finally listen to their users 5 versions of iOS later for a simple tweak (I'm looking at you "turn off wifi for 24 hours" lol, amongst other thing, but thats the latest I know they changed that really impacted me)

I am very fearful about any kind of goverment regulation as well and, in an ideal world, the gaming industry would self-regulate. But, in this horible reality we live in, that will never happen.<br>The best we can hope for is that whatever restrictions the government applies begin and end with "stop pay-to-win and lootboxes". Hopefully they don't start reaching for more power where they shouldn't and ruin other aspects of gaming.<br><br>As far as the financial hit on these companies' bottom line goes, I really don't feel any sympathy for them whatsoever. They built their entire business on the foundation of exploitative monetization and the reduction of the quality of their games for the psychological manipulation of their customers. They deserve to fail.<br>I WANT publishers to try stuffing their products full of unskipppable ads and see if the public will reject the idea or keep gobbling it up like they currently do with lootboxes and pay-to-win. If customers continue to accept the unnacceptable we'll know we're well and truly fucked.

Thank you Lex for this podcast. Utmost importance that specifically YOU made this podcast. I shall always support your work for the advancement of humanity.
I just wanted to throw out a scenario that you "might" not thought of. My mom, who is an older lady, really struggles to push a full shopping cart around the store, a full shopping cart is actually quite heavy for elderly people. Obviously for younger people self pushing carts are pretty joke worthy. But in all seriousness, for older people, self pushing carts would very likely let them shop on their own again. (Yes I know you were joking and I didn't take offense. I just wanted to put this out there.),(reply>), @ryanizer11 Absolutely. Being able to provide all types of people a sense of self worth is an amazing feeling for me, but more importantly that person.,(reply>), @MegaLakona I agree. At least in my moms situation, we have a grocery store that packs the shopping bags, carries the bags to your car, and even loads them into your car for you. So she goes there, and then I just bring them into the house for her. I fully understand this is not the norm everywhere, but it works for her and our personal situation.,(reply>), And people with varies disabilities,(reply>), On the other hand, as a kid the best thing of going with mom shopping was getting to drive the cart ;),(reply>), I know of elderly people that like to be able to use the shopping cart as a walking aid.

In my opinion, some part of the problem lies in "there has been no satisfactory definition of artificial intelligence nor any meaningful EVALUATION METHODS". Especially the latter.,(reply>), I don't think so, most evaluation methods are too narrow and can be bruteforced (Turing test, IQ tests, spatial intuition tests...). I believe the test is to pass all test with at least as good results as humans would do.

Individual EVs are not a long term solution, since we could never sustainably meet demand to replace every current fossil fuel car with an electric one. The resources just aren't there. We'll wreck supplies just in the first run of providing everyone their first EV. Not even thinking of how we'll even renew the fleet a decade or two later. And that's not even accounting for all other applications, like phones or computing. That's why all serious environmental / societal activists would rather prefer we all shift to collective transportation and urban densification. So that we cut our need to even own cars at the root. But one's own personal EV is much more appealing to the masses because, you know, "muh freedom!".

The odd thought I had after watching this video was, just imagine how awful that would have been if golf carts weren't predominantly electric like they are today. In the 70's that was not guaranteed and they'd run on a two-stroke, I wonder if this place required electric carts from the get go. Imagine what that might mean for city streets for automobiles in the future.

I really loved Matt's credit voiceover at the end of the video. It was a great detail guys. Thanks!
the problem with this game isn't that people are being inherently biased against it or anything. It's the way this game portrays the battle. By not portraying the war crimes and atrocities that happened during the battle, such as the use of white phosphorus, it does a disservice to those who were in the battle itself, especially the civilians that witnessed the entire fiasco. If you were a civilian who happened to get permanent and crippling burns from WP shells fired at your house during the battle, you would be pretty angry if this game didn't decide to show the criminal use of WP too, right? As a person who loves tactical games myself (ARMA, Project Reality, etc.) I think that this game should show the atrocities that happened. The devs could have gone with the Spec Ops: The Line route and showed war as it truely was: hell. They could have shown the full scale of things and shove war crimes at your face without toning down anything. They could have showed the suffering of civilians that happened. By not showing the atrocities, this game will feel like another COD. (in terms of how it tones down war) I'm really disappointed the devs didn't show the atrocities.
Anyone else unexcited about the new CPUs?

Love it when two engineers talk without the BS.  IMHO, George actually undersold the Comma a bit.

I don't know how true it is but I read a post from a programmer who was getting complaints that their product took too long to complete it's process, they shipped an update that added a progress bar which actually slightly slowed it down but it stopped the complaints about the speed.

And that's something that you may not have wanted to know.
This is just my personal observation, I am a fanatic of the world and lore created by Mike Pondsmith, and I still consider myself a fan of the tabletop game, and the universe in general, now I was a fan of CD Project Red since the witcher 2 in Xbox 360, being honest I bought their shit, all their bullshite, I played Gwent and give them my money in microtransactions, both merchandise from their store, I truly believe in them, I had played cyberpunk 2077 for 600 hours, 6 games,  3 with male V 3 with female V, and I love and hate this game, the lore is there and even cheesy and truly short the story is not that bad, of course, are better quests that they at least from my point of view unfinished, but to be honest, what broke my heart, what hurt me as a person actively supporting CD project red, was the greed and this air of indolent indifference as they fuck it and now well we will just have one dlc and that is it, that greed and pride, that lack of relaity to say well we got your money and fuck you, hurt me a lot, I will be damned If I buy something from them anymore. The assholes after each can't even give you the haircut of a young rogue you need a freaking mod for that. But I learned my lesson I will never give a single dime to any game developer before any game is out for a year at least. Fuck all Game developers all are the freaking same, all games are dead now. Fuck Corpo shit.

Problem with using car batteries is mass and endurance: having big heavy battery which moved with car reduced efficiency of car if you are not gonna use it in full capacity. Also, aging of battery in car is bigger issue than aging of stationary battery because you got reduced range with same mass. Better solution will be reusing old car batteries in stationary stations. Old battery, that already lost part of capacity, still get enough runtime if you don't need to move it.

You didn‚Äôt tell us what kind of water you used. Tap water contains dissolved minerals which most probably are not available on mars. Rainwater contains dissolved CO2 which is most definitely available on Mars. Better would be to grow them in pure carbon dioxide atmosphere at progressively lower pressures to see how that went. In fact we could be breeding bacteria and fungus and plants to survive in pure CO2 at around 600 Pa so we can grow crops outside when we arrive.

Damn AMD is savage,(reply>), Matthew B. Oh right, so because AMD was right about their 8 core architecture means that it was still unethical to say that an 8 core CPU is an 8 core cpu. K then, also what about the oj murder case? How does a person losing their life fit in with a CPU exactly?,(reply>)," Matthew B. Also I just read about the single lawsuit you're talking about. Here's a direct extract from one of the articles:-<br><br>If the writeup at <a href=""http://legalnewsline.com/"">Legalnewsline.com</a> is¬†remotely accurate", the lawsuit is utterly without technical merit. The suit supposedly alleges that because Bulldozer shares certain core resources, the cores can no longer work independently and the chip is no longer capable of performing eight instructions simultaneously. If that‚Äôs the hook Dickey is hoping to hang his lawsuit on, he picked a bad one. While it‚Äôs true that AMD shared core resources within Bulldozer, the chip doesn‚Äôt work the way Dickey alleges it does.,(reply>), Matthew B. You're* and why wouldn't they want the <b>trash</b> FX line if it was for free idiot. They didn't have to spend anything to get the CPUs so they could make stupidly easy money with the FX CPUs, business 101- if it makes more money than it costs, get it. Also yeah, they did do that because even if AMD came up with something that destroyed the competition people still buy Nvidia. Remember the r9 290x? It cost WAY WAY less than the 780shitTyI and performed equally and sometimes better but people still bought the garbage option. So why bother, if people don't want their tech why would they bother to make it for them? Again, business 101- if no-one buys your shit, don't make it. They got a huge payment from Sony to make Navi, the bottom of the barrel chips are probably gonna go to pc while the top of the line best and most efficient Navi chips will go to consoles most probably.,(reply>), Matthew B. Not that I know of :) I welcome more knowledge, so tell me with solid proof that they did something like Intel did. Also let's assume that it was totally AMDs fault for letting Intel bribe OEMs. But which party was the one here that bribed the OEMs even after they had the option to not to and forced them to use Intel chips even after AMD offered them to have their chips for literally free, I forget. The name was something like shintel, I think it was intelligence or something? OH WAIT, YEAH IT WAS INTEL!,(reply>), So releasing CPUs that aren't really that bad is as bad as being mega anti consumer and anti competitive. Okay, if that's how your brain works.

I was in Fallujah in '04-'05... It was terrible, terrifying, and life changing in a way that cannot be explained. The fact that someone is trying their best to tell the story of what I and many others went through is good to me, simply put. I do not plan on playing this game, but trying to censor and de-platform this story is criminal. Not one scenario while I was there was clear, cut, and dry. It was a muddy mess of moral rose colored glasses. It was a shit show and many people died and it didn't matter where they were from, but they still deserve to have their story told.

Interesting conversation. The problem I see with the Flynn effect, as can be observed by Prof. Haier arguments, is that they have not updated their knowledge on genetics and the genome. Evolution can occur rapidly (in ecological time) and not only due to epigenetic regulatory changes, but also due to genetic changes. I recommend the book by James A. Shapiro - Evolution in its 2nd edition that has both the technical and the general audience sides of the science.

This is the price of globalization, pretty much anything with high tech components and batteries has this issues.  I agree that Tesla owners, myself included, have no business looking down on ICE vehicle owners.  But it is very difficult to function in our society without having a laptop, smart phone, and using tons of useless plastic which is all bad for the planet.  Basically, most of the green energy revolution has been a lie for everyone.  Just like recycling has been for nearly 40 years.  Hope we can fix it.

I imagine it'll become a common thing very soon, with robotics and AI doing the dirty work.,(reply>), @57thorns Yes, I have century old bottles that were pulled out of a landfill, and aside from needing new seals, they are perfectly functional.,(reply>), This is so true. Landfills are much better, concentrated and preserved under a coat of soil.

The problem of your speed or lack thereof when teleporting assumes that there's some type of absolute reference frame for objects in the universe that they move in relation to. It makes the most sense that you'd be maintaining the momentum you were traveling in and interdimensionally affected by the gravity you were near before and while you're teleporting.

I had a professor that was a single-engine light-aircraft pilot. He explained this phenomenon in one of our classes, and he theorized that JFK Jr's crash had the graveyard spiral as the main cause. It was at night, he had an injury to his ankle, and it was a plane that he wasn't that experienced in. No mechanical failure, no distress call, and death on impact means that it was likely that he didn't know that he was going down until just before impact.

Had only a ps2 and GBA (eventually a DS) when I was young. When I built my PC in 2015 about, yeah I noticed! Nowadays it would be worse still. Still can‚Äôt bring myself to play these MTX filled games, or anything online multiplayer really. DLC in its original sense, an expansion to a game that gives you extra content post release, that can be amazing! Should surprise me little though. Natural considering human greed. ‚ÄûLet‚Äôs Go Whaling‚Äú is a great watch.
When I first heard of covid in November/December 2019, when there were also protests in Hong Kong, I thought how convenient a viral infection, quarantine, and curfew was to quell the unrest.  That would be a more malevolent theory, but not quite out of the wheel house what the Chinese government is capable of doing.  It certainly is coincidental.

I could get my copy of Emperor the Battle for Dune to work, well that is until the first scripted appearance of the worm. As it would crash my game every time making it effectively unplayable. Such a bummer...<br><br>Also we know that always online games are slated to absolutely die off eventually and become completely unplayable. This was my concern when I first found out about it through my copy of Diablo III and how I will lose everything I did in that game. It made me stop playing it when it went into maintenance mode and I have no interest in any other games like it.

These people that manipulate and push for their agenda in gaming and elsewhere can't logically back up their statements and demands, so the solution is to lie, confuse, gaslight etc. until the other side just gives up because you can't reason with such nonsense. And even if you manage to counter their attacks, they come up with a new bullshit term for why "you are misrepresenting their points/goals" points and goals they themselves can't even explain. And if all else fails, you're a racist or a nazi and get your shit cancelled.
I still play my xbox 360, personally. There are some newer games that interest me, but due to a combination of upgrading being more that I can afford, and all the MTX's going on, I've avoided trying to upgrade. Plus I prefer single player games and most current ones are all multiplayer-oriented

If a company produces what is promised, than surpasses that mark.. I will fully support them and for the most part believe what they say/show, I'll probably get burned on that but I dunno. But considering the only developer I've given that kinda faith too is CD Projekt Red I think I'm in safe hands. The Witcher 3 was probably one of the best games every made, with free updates.. I know they had paid DLC but it was probably some of the best DLC every produced.. They are on another level that no one will reach,(reply>), Nullock Alwin And the dlc was fucking amazing for a great price to boot. Like, what, wasn't Blood and Wine 15-20 bucks? Easily worth it, whereas Bethesda wants 18 bucks for FUCKING BLUE PAINT for power armour. Like wtf.
Video games DO cause violence. You ever played arcade games like tetris?

Unless the grid is paying a significant premium for the energy why would you want to offer up your car battery? With charging inefficiency and losses converting AC to DC and back to AC for the grid would be just donating your money to the grid. Or am I missing something here?,(reply>), If your car knows to charge itself during periods of low demand, and sell that energy back to the grid during periods of high demand, then you will be buying low and selling high which will make a profit.

Good work!   Being a child of the '60s and '70s, I'm very familiar with those looks. You nailed them! One thing that you can add for extra detail. is a 60 &amp; 120 Hz buzz whenever white titles appear on screen. (50 &amp; 100Hz for PAL system users) This was a direct result of the composite video signal, that if the video level got just a tiniest bit too high, it would bleed into the audio channel creating a buzz.,(reply>), ALSO REMEMBER that most 1960s to Mid-90s TV shows were recorded or stored on analog tape (Umatic, Betamax, VHS, Betacam, S-VHS).

And now I understand why my British colleague and I found that noise particularly annoying in the US: the frequency was lower there, and therefore probably seemed louder than what we were used to in our home countries (Australia in my case). Our boss, who was older and thus probably couldn't hear it, didn't understand what we were complaining about. (P.S: I'm in my mid-40s now, so my vision is seriously deteriorating, and I'm missing that a lot more than high-pitched monitor sounds. So enjoy that while it lasts, too.)

Okay, this launched me into an existential crisis. This is where IT'S at. This field is where everything is happening. And me, being a humanities major, I feel like I'm watching universe experiencing itself through a youtube video. Man... I wish I got involved with all this real time magic. Does anyone know any books that could get me more into this field? Beginner level, yet to get a firmer grasp onto the whole ungraspable thing (for my limited humanities brain). Has anyone changed their career path in their 30s? Feels like im too old already for something like this, yet I'm never getting any younger, it's asap or never. Oh man, what great minds, what a majestic thing science is... I'm in awe, yet I feel like I made the wrong choices. The universe experiencing itself through me made the wrong choices,(reply>), @Carlos Mario Rodriguez Lara Lol, dude,  you have such an idiotic understanding of human culture,  almost two bit level. Humanities is not about solving problems, and the the guy above is obviously a troll,(reply>), I don‚Äôt think your humanities major is to blame for feeling that way. The problems that they are trying to solve dwarf anything I‚Äôve worked on as a robotics and machine vision expert. Makes you want to change your focus into something more meaningful for humanity.,(reply>), It depends on what kind of role you want to transition to (technical roles will require computer science / math backgrounds). The book, "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach", may be a good starting point to give you an idea of what AI is like.

WRONG! The entire gaming market is down not because of "predatory tactics" but because of numerous other reasons.

Lex has people on like Donald Hoffman and others you have shown that there is no substance universe but as soon as he has some guy on entranced by the illusionary human body he defaults to being a piece of meat doomed to annihilation.  Consciousness is the author of all and cannot end.  The particular story you're living right now may end but you won't.  The data of human experience tells us that we will return to our true nature of Love and Light. If we really want to be useful that is the knowledge we should impart to our loved ones
My father worked at Perry nuclear power plant in Ohio for over 30 years. When we would go fishing on Lake Erie, before 9/11 and increased security concerns, we would often go out to what was called "the bubble". It was the cooling water outlet from the plant. It was a giant pipe emerging from the bottom of the lake, well below the surface, and the water around it was the clearest I've ever seen in that lake. It was warm and full of fish. You could see the rumble of expelled water on the surface, hence the name. We had no shame about diving in and touching bottom or just lounging around. I seem to remember my father cautioning us about staying in too long, but I think that had more to do with making the guard towers on land nervous than anything else.,(reply>), only in Ohio bruh üíÄüíÄüíØ,(reply>), ‚öõÔ∏è‚öõÔ∏è‚öõÔ∏è,(reply>), @Atlas cooling towers use water from the lake.  They spray it on the steam pipes, like a heat exchanger.  That's why the wastewater from nuclear plants is so safe.,(reply>), @Howard Nelson bro you just doxxed your dad üíÄ,(reply>), I just looked it up and Perry NPP has cooling towers. Do they use the lake water as an auxiliary system?
Narration at the end... Is nice!

As much as a appreciate a willingness to talk to everyone, religion is pretty much the antithesis of science. Pronouncements and claims without evidence. The opposite of what I attracted me to this podcast to begin with.,(reply>), @seeker_of_knowlage No not absolute, as you cannot prove general claims that are negative claims -- one cannot prove that ghosts do not exist; one cannot prove that leprechauns too do not exist. One simply cannot prove a negative and general claim. You can infer that the claim is highly unlikely though.,(reply>), Ok smart guy, What is science?<br><br>Let me ask another question, is science absolute?,(reply>), <b>·¥õhŒ±nks fœÉr wŒ±tch√≠ng..</b><br><b>mŒ±k—î Œ± nœÉt—î tœÉ Mason Watson –≤—á t—î—Öt√≠ng h√≠m —áœÉu wh—îr—î r—îf—îrr—îd –≤—á m—î —áœÉu‚Äôll –≤—î gu√≠d—îd r—îgŒ±rd√≠ng cr—áptœÉ √≠nv—îstm—înt –≤tc/—îth sk√≠lls‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..¬±ùüèùüìùüèùüëùüóùüïùüéùüéùüëùüêùüî</b><br>‚úçÔ∏è ·µí‚Åø  ∑ ∞·µÉ·µóÀ¢·µÉ·µñ·µñ<br><br><b>l—ît h√≠m knœÉw √≠ s—înt —áœÉuüöÄüöÄüíØ...‚Ä¶</b>

WWI and WWII had little to do with religion as a cause. Deaths under communism also have nothing to do with religion but are occuring in the abscence of it. Gen 1 without religion can barely decide on their gender let alone function and start a family (the core unit for a healthy society),(reply>), @Marouane¬† only adding fuel to the religious wars going on....spreading lies,(reply>), @Robocop 420 you annoyed that this episode impacted someone haha, let off.,(reply>), To what ??

Even if it's limited to only what you can see, that still doesn't stop you from cutting with surgical precision, welding, flying, creating energy shields to stop bullets like neo, having super strength, making regular objects homing high-speed bullets, unlocking doors, crushing, exploding, and most of these have a lot of uses besides the obvious like welding could be used to heal wounds and fix bones.,(reply>), @*****¬†Yes I meant her, and yeah.. maybe the others aren't powerful enough?

crazy to me how kotkin comes to mention the contingencies of ussr's history and communism history yet fails to consider them at all in his analisys. "what would've stalin become if it werent for lenin's death"; lenin had his party as lex said put in place these institutions to constraint one's power. kotkin doesnt dive in that area where ussr and the revolution brought alot of the rights and progressive ideas that we live under today (abortions, women's right, divorce, lgbt right, civil rights etc. etc.). "everywhere communism was tried historically it failed; produced an immense amount of casaulties" without mentionning the very economical contingencies that were put on these regimes by the capitalist world for it to fail (latin america are the best example).  he said himself, that capitalist economies produced fascist nazi authoritharian states, based on historical contingencies. how is that a fair treatment of ussr history? so capitalism go fascist in the 30's and its historical contingencies, commmunsism goes authoritarian under economical pressure and its a problem of ideology and equality of outcome. how can you study ussr and communsim your whole life and simply backhand brush it to the garbage like that. that's crazy to me, as if he chose to become a ussr historian just to find confirmation that communism is bad.

Before you had tesla there was not enough motivation to fix this problem, so you are fundamentally wrong!

It's kind of sad that people these days seem more interested in talking about microtransactions and graphics than the actual gameplay of games.

i deleted my facebook account 2 months ago. yesterday, i tried to create a new account to try to sell things in the facebook marketplace and they've disabled/banned me/won't allow me to create a new account, saying i went against their community guidelines. all i ever posted were photos of vintage motorcycles i liked (with no female models). i've put it up for review but they just say no. whatever, it reminded me why i deleted it to begin with.

"The smallest Von Neumann constructor"  pre-supposes the existence of the 'matrix', for want of a better word, all sorts of matter, and a consciousness that a constructor can "realize" that it can mutate.  I'm enjoying the discussion, but I'm guessing that the "miracle" of creating these constructors will not be addressed by Cronin.

Waaaaay better than the Vitalik interview
They didn't beat nato.  They just hid till we left.  When you beat someone so bad that they won't come out and fight that doesn't mean they won lol,(reply>), Exactly. From a purely military standpoint. the U.S. and its allies thoroughly kicked the Taliban's ass within <b>weeks</b> of arriving in-country in the Fall of 2001. After that, there wasn't anything more to prove. NATO and the U.S. disengaged from initiating combat with Taliban long before they officially left the country. By the end, it was pretty much just anti-terror/IS operations. The Taliban's victory in Afghanistan was a political victory, not a military victory. NATO consistently out-performed the Taliban by every measure, and won every engagement. The Taliban can and should celebrate their victory, but they and others should also be under no illusions that they "beat" the U.S. If killing Afghans was truly in our hearts as American citizens, we could turn that entire country into a parking-lot with very little effort and in very short order. <br><br>It was never about killing people. It was about standing up an effective professional military capable of defending a democratically-elected government that represents and ensures the internationally-recognized human rights of all Afghans, regardless of tribe or even gender. Corruption in the Afghan military and government made that goal all but impossible. As untold numbers of cash -- we're talking huge pallets of American cash were dropped into the country, earmarked for defending the Afghan government and people. The commanders  pocketed this money, instead of ensuring their men were well-equipped, well-trained, and most importantly, well-paid. It's because of this corruption that so many Afghan soldiers felt so little allegiance and patriotism towards their corrupt-as-fuck government, and if they didn't burn their uniforms and walk home, they surrendered when the Taliban attacked, without even firing a single shot. <br><br>The Afghan military and government were not worth fighting for. And American politicians LIED to the American people about this... for YEARS. They knew about the corruption and the incompetence and the lack of a cohesive military that could effectively stand against the Taliban... and they ignored it, and did nothing but crow about the political successes we were achieving in Afghanistan. And it was all horse shit. A lot of people knew it anyway, if they paid attention... but the average American was completely clueless to just how dire the situation was and had been for years. And when Trump finally signed the capitulation agreement, the Taliban had won. They had successfully waited us out.

One thing you didn't touch on is the energy that powers an electric vehicle comes mostly from fossil fuel power plants, as we can't use nuclear and wind/solar don't produce enough energy.  Honestly, it's like ethanol all over again.,(reply>), @Brian Except an EV requires energy generated from emission spewing fossil fuels.  It may not directly expel emissions but there are still emissions.  Combined with the environmental destruction to produce the damn things and tell me again how green they are.,(reply>), so does the energy that oil refineries use, to produce the fuel your car needs..... and your car still puts out emissions everywhere it goes afterwards. An EV does not.

This was proposed years ago and letting the power companies wear out the batteries <br>in your EV it is still a stupid idea.

Someone else wears it out !<br>Have you heard of any power companies that are willing to replace the battery in your EV ?<br>How you get someone else to pay for energy storage is wind and solar's dirty little secret. <br>Our new government program won't cost you anything because the other guy will pay.

i don't think such discoveries have all been found or will ever all be found. a nice recent one is finding rock concretions containing plastic. show that to anyone and they'll understand that plastic pollution is a problem. or fossils showing some dinosaurs had feathers. or the ancient remains of Lucy and other far ancestors showing humans evolved in east africa. or the measurements taken by hubble that proved the universe is expanding and that the milky way is just one of countless galaxies. they're obvious to us living now and if you showed them to people from not too long ago you'd blow their minds.

The question is: are all the variables associated with long-term investing (economic cycles, political risk, disruption, etc.) actually systemically forecastable or are the likes of Warren Buffet just glorified noise traders?,(reply>), None of what you mentioned is likely systematically forecastable, but Warren Buffett is definitely not trying to forecast those things. The order of magnitude of the things you mentioned on a time scale of years, and Warren is trying to estimate fair value realized over decades

How can your hearing be going already?

Average (mean) lifespan of communicating species is surely an astronomical figure; in only a couple hundred years humans will likely reach a technological level which makes them borderline impossible to eradicate. Much like the bacteria which took hold on Earth and became impossible to root out by any means short of the Sun swallowing the Earth, once intelligent life reaches a certain technological level it creates a new paradigm that can never go back.,(reply>), Thats the exact human ego that destroyed us.. smh.,(reply>), How do you figure that in a couple hundred years we will be almost impossible to eradicate? What's your bases ?,(reply>), They found radiation on planets such as Mars. And apparently Mars was said to be habitable for life millions of years ago. What if nukes killed Martians off? Or if they're still there. We have tons of pictures of Pyramid-like structures on Mars. And they found water underneath the surface on both the Moon and Mars. They're saying there's life underneath the surface, that might just be classified information. Who knows,(reply>), It's only astronomical if you assume its astronomical. For all we know, next week nukes can be flying over our heads and our species will be gone
It breaks my heart to hear you are losing faith in the professional class as a whole Lex, you of all people should better insulated from making the mistake of amplifying the outliers.

Nice to see you take a more deeper take on the crazy EV world. Just add to all this the next migration caused by climatic shift that I was estimating to ~10years to become a real issues, but when you factor the ideocracy of EVs... wheel that crises may happen earlier and scaled by ~20dB.,(reply>), @1810Jeff still that is insignificant compared to mining.,(reply>), You know I wonder what could be causing all the droughts, maybe it's all of the moisture being sapped away from places that grow crops until they have to import water which will only sap more and more water.
My parents would blast extremely loud music everywhere when in the car it didn't matter if I was in the car or not. From when I was like 6-14 they would constantly play music like that and now my hearing is way worse than most of my peers. It angers me how much my parents would ignore me. I hear at max 14000 Hz and I am a teenager. At least I have better eye sight than everyone in my family.

Yet major companies keep forcing digital sales pretendig physical media is something  from the past. The truth: bigger $ cuts is software distribuiton, less spendings on resources for the same selling price, abolition of second hand marketing (aka total monopoly over sales) and a "legal" protection against unfinished/broken games that might be patched later (or just abandoned as they are). You said it: we own the rights to a license... we dont own the product and it can be taken from us at any time or changed as companies see fit (aka: inclusion of microtransactions, etc). I can say i OWN all my physical copies and can play those games anytime i want they and exactly how i bought them, no shenanigans attached.

So approximately 10 minutes ago I was notified that you had just uploaded this video.   I think there's a discrepancy somewhere
Brian Greene is a smart guy, but I find it curious that someone so smart can assert that free will does not exist. If you take the determinism perspective to it‚Äôs logical conclusion it becomes a self refuting concept.<br><br>If we‚Äôre all just governed by the deterministic laws of physics, what makes the same laws that govern my every thought, emotion, action, less ‚Äúright‚Äù than those same laws that govern his every action and thought? How does that make sense? In his view there is no right or wrong, just forced output of deterministic events that are 100% outside of his control‚Ä¶.even his assertion that free will is nonexistent.,(reply>), @victoriouse and to be clear, I don‚Äôt know what free will is or how it would even work‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just saying that the determinism position isn‚Äôt helpful either and asserting that it is true is premature. We don‚Äôt even understand consciousness, how would we even begin to understand an abstract concept like free will? Maybe we don‚Äôt have the mental framework to even begin to understand the dynamics of the mind.,(reply>), @B Herd why do you believe you are determined?,(reply>), @victoriouse how can you trust any conclusion that you arrive at if you were just forced to think it?,(reply>), If you take the determinism perspective to it‚Äôs logical conclusion it becomes a self refuting concept. Please take me through your "logical conclusion", since my logical conclusion of it is simple and it doesn't refute itself. So I am curious.<br><br>He never claimed that his thoughts etc are less right just because he believes there's no free will, IF there's no free will, that just means that you have no control over them in a vacuum. IF it's all determinism, then everything anyone ever thought is a "correct" thought, that doesn't mean the thoughts are all true statements on reality, just that the thought itself is a legit thought.<br><br>And maybe, if you'd like, explain to me what you think free will is,(reply>), You almost had me. Until I remembered that physical laws created your thoughts and you had no free will.  Hello from my prison to yours.
If you banned pron0graphy....I would be willing to bet my eternal soul that crime, assault (especially r@pe), depression, and suicide would skyrocket. The same can be said for video games. Banning violent video games will increase violence, depression, and suicide. Humans are animals. So much about us is determined by millions of years of evolution, and a whole soup of chemicals and hormones inside us that dictate almost everything we do. We need our outlets. If you take those outlets away....we will implode.

Escalators. Unlike Elevators (Lifts, for you Brits), Escalators don't/can't have counter weights. But why couldn't Escalators have generators or massive flywheels to generate or store energy of the ones carrying people downward?  That could then be used to help drive the ones carrying people up.,(reply>), Da Hai Zhu escalators do have a counter weight.  A the top of the escalator the stairs go under the escalator and head down this acts as the counter weight.,(reply>), REALLY??,(reply>), Escalators running downwards usually use their motor as a generator an produce electricity when more than two or three people are on them.,(reply>), Well," Tom Scott made a video about another type of elevator: <a href=""https://youtu.be/YgJBD1wf-YQ"">https://youtu.be/YgJBD1wf-YQ</a> so I guess people already experimented a lot with them."

Such beautiful answers.<br>I hope it's Ilya Sutskever or someone with a similar moral compass that first creates AGI - both for the machine and for humanity. That said, if he's working at OpenAI, I'm not sure his admirable moral sense will matter - it's a business and will sell to the highest bidder as it has done before. I'm also not sure there will be a strict definition of "AGI" that will be met, rather it will be iterative and not obvious until it is really obvious.. if that makes sense.<br>I really hope that when/if it comes to it, OpenAI can stand by its original purpose.

what is the argument against it exactly? If you think it's confusing to beginners, don't teach it. If you don't find it useful, don't use it.

The alternative is a lot of nested if blocks which can get pretty messy.

LINUS FOR PRESEDENT
Yahshua - you know Him as Jesus - was born to a virgin, turned water to wine, taught, healed the sick, raised the dead, casted out demons, walked on water, calmed the storm, and fed a crowd of thousands with a few fish and a few loaves of bread, among many other things. He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God (2 Thessalonians 2:1-4). Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh," returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!!!!!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus", and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead," thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany", in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done," be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found", call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God," for he will abundantly pardon....<br><br>To anoint your self", the sick," or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead", and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick," place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

I don't think I'll get this game for 2 reasons.<br>1. What I've seen of the story online looks garbage. It looks like some idiot at Ubisoft saw how much the left wing games "journalists" gushed over Spec Ops: The Line and wanted to basically copy that as their story, and basically say that the option you should've chosen is the "secret ending" where you ignore a dangerous psychopath who has harmed at least one person that we know of at this point, and who in response to an arrest warrant orders his cultists to basically forcefully convert or kill everyone in the region... yeah, fuck that. He's clearly not harmless, and clearly needs to be dealt with (and the best ending involves you getting about 6 minutes of boring gameplay from a full price retail).<br><br><b>[ENDING SPOILERS]</b><br>The game doesn't give you any kind of decent ending choice. Your choices are to basically accept the message that the game is basically FORCING you to accept which is... what? I'm not entirely sure... defeatism (any time you try to make the world better it makes things worse so don't even bother)? Anti-police/policing? Are they trying to shame us for enjoying shooter games?<br><br>So your choices are to either try to kill him, in which case you fail, you end up his captive and everyone else ends up dead (and the US gets fucking nuked), or you walk away and leave your comrades in arms as his prisoners and get brainwashed into attacking your other comrades in arms (and since they control the radio station it is believable that Joseph was behind the trigger song playing on the radio), but for some reason this ending doesn't result in a nuclear apocalypse.<br><br>"It means I was right" good for you, buy everyone died, so it means your efforts achieved nothing. Now if instead of a violent cult you made a Prepper community, things would've gone VERY differently.<br><b>[/SPOILERS]</b><br><br>2. This TMK is the first real country they've included, and it is clearly painting right wing Christians as dangerous (e.g. Preppers, which Watch Dogs makes a survivalist militia a major enemy faction, so it isn't the first time), yet if they were to do something similar like have Far Cry 6 be set in a fictional district in the UK fighting extremist Muslims (with a more moderate group aiding you like the Christian pastor in this game) who've taken over, are killing and kidnapping, forcefully converting etc the local populace, it would spark INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE and likely be banned in the UK and Muslim majority countries.<br><br>I'm not Christian or American but that double standard bugs the hell out of me.<br><br>And that's without getting into the premise... in an age of satellite dishes and satellite phones the idea that this could happen without anyone hearing about it is ridiculous, and they have planes and choppers that they can just fly out of the valley. At least with games like Far Cry 4, the idea is the world knows, but doesn't care.<br><br>As for Polygon... they're lunatics and have been for years (I thought that was basically common knowledge). If Ubisoft decides to let their comments influence how they design their games going forward they're idiots.

The cliched phrase 'Timing is everything' captures what's wrong with the 'cultural filtering' in our  country. Doubling or tripling the number of young people your age with your level of success would be far better than having another Elon Musk. A goal of 10 to 100 times the actual number of young successful (at your level) people globally would increase the chance of doubling or tripling that number. It would increase the chance that true democracy could emerge and would make it a lot easier to deal with broken and evil people. David Butler

"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hppbxV9C63g&amp;t=2h10m00s"">2:10:00</a> I started wondering what if you compared the outcomes of adopted children compared to the biological children of successful parents? Are there any studies that make this comparison? Assuming that the parents treat the adopted and biological children with the same amount of care", I think finding differences here could be another important piece of evidence for the role that genetics play in the g-factor. Edit: I haven't finished the podcast yet so maybe they bring this up.,(reply>), There were indeed studies of that nature. As a whole they are refered to as "twin" studies where they specifically tested the iq of ttwins where one twin was adopted and the other raised by the biological parents. Long story short : upbringing does have a small effect but the vast majority of tested individuals were very close to the aggregate iq of their parents indicating that genetics is a far stronger predictor of iq than nurture.

"exceeds ambient levels" wouldn't any additional radiation make that happen?,(reply>), amount of tolerable radiation is two or three orders of magnitude above what's "ambient" over most of the world. If the artifacts' radioactivity has lasted 100 years, then the level of radiation it produces is so low that its health effect is negligible. I've worked in undergraduate physics labs where we spent three hours multiple weeks in a row handling gamma sources with half-lives of around 5 years (Co-60), all with literally zero fancy safety precautions. With a half-life 320 times shorter than the radium isotope here, those sources put off roughly 320 times the amount of radiation in the same period. Additionally, radium is mostly an alpha source--most of the output is stopped by the skin. Radon is the real safety concern, but with a 1600yr half-life, a radium sample produces at most a few thousand atoms of radon in a day. My guess is the parks service closed the beach for PR reasons more than actual safety ones.,(reply>), I suppose that "ambient levels" is a range within the radioactivity is safe to be around, rather than the average level of background radiation in an area.,(reply>), As far as I know, ambient levels fall in a range, and often vary wildly by location. When radiation is "above ambient levels" it doesn't mean it's above average, it means that it's above the upper limit of what could be considered normal, mostly harmless background radiation.

I know these are already recorded but this brought up a question for me. The neurosurgeon said that they would spend an hour or so drilling a large hole in the skull to access a tumour, well that's all fine and well but what do they do about the fluid that's supposed to protect your brain and keep it afloat so it doesn't press against the skull too much? Would they drain it out and re-insert it after they're done? Or would they use a different fluid? And does this impose any time constraints on the operation, having reduced fluid in the skull? Thanks in advance to anyone who can answer any of these questions.,(reply>), The fluid will very slowly ooze out throughout the operation. We do what we can to minimise it and we don't generally replace it. The volumes that are drained are quite small and the brain will replenish it within half a day or so after the operation. <br><br>Draining way too much can lead to nasty headaches though.
He is ignoring the fact that conscience awareness is part of the fabric of quantum physics, the whole universe only bothers to exist when consciences is observing it. When we make the tools to view deep in to the universe we are in fact creating those parts of the universe when we peer in to the void, without our observational effect to collapse the probability wave the universe would not bother to resolve them, In fact the Big Bang itself as described by layman terms seems to me to be the state of a universe which has no observers in it. like an empty photoshop document waiting for pixels to be drawn. The laws of thermodynamics as we know them state that we always are drifting towards this state of chaos and disorder, entropic decay is a never ending one way trip to a cold dead universe. Then how does life evolve from that? How does a series of system seem to arise out of chaos and self order? First the DNA does this then one celled life, then multi cellular, all the way up to us? How so? The more we describe the universe the more we have to acknowledge these few facts that clearly demonstrate that we are wrong about the cosmological theories we have.

I've run into this a couple times. The enormous cost of classic Pok√©mon games, the complete loss of Pok√©mon Dream World, the delisting of the original Titanfall on Steam, several Halo promotional websites/ARGs, and more recently the removal of so much content from Destiny 2. These aren't random indie games that were simply forgotten about, these were high budget studios either ceasing to support or actively removing access to their work. These games deserve to be preserved and large companies don't seem interested in doing it themselves. The best solution I've heard is lowering the length of copyright protection to be equal to that of patents, and then offering an extension to the length of protection by maybe 10 additional years if the copyright holder files a copy of their work with the Library of Congress, which would mean the work would become public domain and easily accessible once the copyright ends.,(reply>), Brilliant and thanks for sharing. I haven‚Äôt seen that solution before but it‚Äôs the best one I‚Äôve seen.

I've always disliked the Play Station controller and never understood how anyone liked it, especially compared to the Xbox 360 controller.  On the PS controller, the dual analogs were always in an awkward spot in relation to my thumbs, I'd rather have the left analog where the dpad is... Also, the L2/R2 buttons on the PS controller always made it feel as though the buttons were falling off the controller and taking my fingers with them whenever I used those buttons, and the PS controller has always been too small.. And I have average sized hands, it's just too small,(reply>), I personally never got the appeal of having the controller be asymmetrical, do most people grip their controllers differently with their left and right hands? Wait, I actually just thought of a potential reason...perhaps it's about whether you prefer your thumbs both to be resting on the analog sticks, or one resting on an analog stick and the other on the buttons? But then that would mean I would be more likely to prefer Xbox controllers as I play RPGs more than shooters, with shooters needing you to use the right analog more and RPGs using the buttons more... On the topic of the shoulder buttons, the upper triggers I feel Sony did a good job with, but the lower triggers it took me some time to get used to after going from the ps2 to the ps3, for the same reason of feeling that the buttons were going to fall off. To address your last point, I never had a problem with thinking the controllers were too small myself, though I have never even considered whether my hands are of average size or not.

Sadly, there are no dragonball teleporting sounds
Relativity fail. You talk about relative to earth, but it's actually relative to you that's important, there is no absolute reference frame. You move in XYZ direction D distance without moving through the intervening space. All calculations are done as if you are motionless and therefor no momentum. <br><br>The pole to equator problem is solved since relative to you the earth is rotating around you while you spin, if you could see from the north pole to equador it would appear motionless to you while stuff in space like stars and planets would appear to be moving in the background. If you teleport there the stuff in space is still moving at the exact same speed it was, while you are still unmoving. This is why stuff on earth doesn't fall towards the equator (like things moving outwards on a spinning disc) but rather fall directly towards the center of the planet. <br><br>The coriolis effect only matters when the time of departure is different to the time of arrival because the object you are shooting at has moved, but since you're moving instantaneously it doesn't apply. From your point of view the Earth and everything on it remains essentially motionless. <br><br>Now ask me how I know you're an atheist.

Where did they find that G.Skill Trident Z Royal RGB kit with that many modules? I hope they haven't been stupid enough to mix RAM kits...<br><br>Also, let's have a moment of silence for all the money THQ Nordic (not Deep Silver, because fuck those guys as they killed off the Sacred franchise) is going to lose because of the move to the Epic Games store. You may have to pay Steam a lot of money, for you to have them host your product, but a lot of people are just going to pirate the game now, because they refuse to get yet another freakin' games launcher. Not that'd I'd expect anything less from Deep Silver, come to think of it...<br><br>I think the video of the Roomba lawn mower was way too high quality. Is there any way you could remove some of its pixels? Thank you.
Already completed and uninstalled it to make space anyways lol

It's funny, that Steam launched a chat update, that makes it work like Discord, so Discord is making a game store to compete with Steam.
the red flag might have been wrong, but it shows the importance of checking and verifying sources, rather than believing everything we read online. Critical thinking, research, and examination skills are more important than ever
I hope discord don't take the deal but as they went to MS first it looks like its gonna happen. I just hope they don't trash it and throw it away.,(reply>), @ash M I don't think they'll put paywalls, but they definetly will implement M$ accounts. They are doing it with Minecraft too, a videogame, so why not an app?,(reply>), @Azarilh Namu I just hope I won't need a microsoft account to use discord or that they lock features behind paywalls. Its one of the few decent apps out there,(reply>), Discord doesn't have a good money supply right now, i don't understand how is it still alive. Of course they want to sell it before it's too late, i'm not surprised they offered the deal.

Insert obligatory "it's just a game" comment. Seriously, it's cool to have accurate representation in games....but it's still just a game and people need to remember this from time to time. Obviously manufacturers and military won't give certain information to game companies. Ace combat won't have accurate representation. Microsoft flight Sim won't have accurate representation. This game is no different

"The humbling reality that i am not special",(reply>), @Robbie Life is a result of some premeditated acts but also a kind of controlled chaos and random circumstances. The world as we know it is run by mere circumstances and it can go many ways. There is a low chance of getting sucken on by a black hole but it is still possible. Fate doesn't exist. Just results that come into fruition by a set of certain actions and possibilities.,(reply>), @YourMackDaddy lol you've been brainwashed. Nothing is a accident,(reply>), @Robbie because that's the way the balls rolled. Determinism. This is how it ended up being, but it's by chance and circumstance. Everything is a constant cosmic accident that could only happen as it has. I am here because my parents had me because their parents had them and so on. But there was no intention or reason other than for all the previous moments and their content that span into the past to the beginning of time.,(reply>), @Theme Master you think you aren't special? Why are you here then?,(reply>), @Robbie No lol, we're not inherently special. Many people are not special, it's up to them to recognize it and fix it.

That us really cool. And I wouldn't gave even thought of it unless you pointed it out but as a visually impared individual I've had experience with having trouble with trucks witness back-up beeps. I hear that beep and depending on the situation it can be unclear where the sound is coming from. But thinking about busses that give off that hydraulic hiss that's similar to the white noise sound Tom mention here, I'm almost always able to pick out which vehicle that sound came from, unlike the beep. Like I said, I hadn't really thought about it until this video, but thinking back, it's true. Very cool. üòÉ

GameStop has people from Chewy on board, which is the company that's aggressively eating into PetSmart and PetCo's market by moving to an online format. GameStop will probably become like Newegg but as a more recognizable brand and selling more game-specific stuff at good deals such as pc components, mice, keyboards, and continuing to sell consoles and controllers. Honestly, this is the best and really only direction to take GameStop and I'm excited to see how they accomplish this.

Oof. It's so annoying when you're listening to someone thinking wow! I never knew any of this amazing info! And then they drop one point that overlaps with your own knowledge and it turns out to be fairly dubious and rhetorical. In this case, the Aussie PM Scott Morrison was not in any way courageous, he has never done a courageous thing in his life. He insisted on investigating China to play upon anti-Chinese sentiment in his voter base and distract from his unpopularity after a few big scandals broke. He was effectively a COVID denier for as long as that was popular, then pulled a 180 when he realised it wasn't playing well.

Step by step, we're just getting started.,(reply>), The first car will notice a difference, slow down to "remap the environment".<br>It's like us: when we are on a familiar road we go pretty fast, but the moment we notice "something's different" we "slow down" because we are "remapping" the environment.  <br><br>However every single human driver on that road with a difference (like a downed branch) will have to do that remapping.  <br><br>With autonomous systems, the fleet can learn together. The first car "remaps" and every other car can learn from it.<br><br>Additionally, the "fleet" can seamlessly report obstructions to the relevant authorities so that it's cleared out quicker than it would  be when relying on a fraction of humans who encounter such obstructions to text/call while driving,(reply>), Yeah but when these cars become mainstream the effort to improve the streets would be imperative for the economy.

But of what I know, it's a benevolent one.

See. I am not a member of a agency. But I do good work all the same. So no, you couldn't insult me. Because you never even asked, and never could. But hey, You have been fun for a few days for my enjoyment. So thanks, you were fun to rile up. What's with you conspiracists and labeling anyone else as a fed anyway? Must be fun. Like the flat earthers.,(reply>), @Formous I insulted your whole agency. Tell your handlers I insulted them too.,(reply>), @kavky allow me to explain a bit I have learned about you. You are aggressive. You have decided to, without knowing who I really am, label me as a member of something you can't confirm. You desire to believe that the government is all lies and that they are doing shady things to you at all times, unless you are vigilant because that scares the big baddies away. Ooooo those evil feds. No good at all. As if a fed would care about a 2 bit loon on the random web to damage control as if I sought you out.  You think and idolize Snowden simply because he may have hurt your boogeyman, which is comprised of honest people doing honest jobs. Would you walk up to some airman in the airforce and jab your finger at him? No?Yes? Whatever the answer, you hate him or her for no other reason than being federal. You think you safe because you shout online at anyone who contests you? Hardly. There are worse evils in the world and those 'feds' who don't have time for a accusations are the shield of a grand design out there sacrificing daily for your benefit. You just don't know enough. About me, or them, to make any sense or have any right to criticize them, or me. Who were the ones Snowden got killed? I can't name them. Because I don't know their names. I just know they were our people. Our friends. And Snowden signed their death warrants.

Glad to see UEG shedding light on this topic. Ross from Accursed Farms has been a vocal opponent to the way large companies treat game preservation for years and has several good videos on the topic, including his semi-viral '"Games as a service" is fraud' video that goes way more in depth on the topic.,(reply>), "Gamers as a service" more like,(reply>), @Sirmooses There's always one who has to go on and completely miss the point and yet still think they're making a righteous statement.,(reply>), I know it's ridiculous these companies can make a product and then be allowed to sell it in a way that they want rather than what I and anybody else wants. All games should be forced to be made on every single format all the way back to the Commodore 64, because I may want to load one up for one day once every few years. And while we're at it how about other forms of media? Why should I have to watch something on Netflix when my Kodascope still runs just fine? This whole "Digital" trend is fraud.

Sorry, this guy (Colton?) needs a lot more practice and/or training to reach the standard Techlinked has set so far, as do a lot of other "newer" faces on Techlinked and ShortCircuit.

I felt guilty about the Irish bit so just want to clarify YES Ireland is not part of the UK; Northern Ireland is, but it's fair to say both have endured their fair share of hardship, no?? In my opinion, any Ireland should have equal opportunity to win a single McCrispy chair for the country -RM,(reply>), Don't worry about it.  On Friday's WAN show Linus asked if Luxemburg is a country and Jake confirmed that it was not.  We don't come here for your geographical and geo-political expertise.,(reply>), @Liam Morris I linked a study from I think 2021 in this thread. Irish actually got closer as the preferred one vs 10 years ago.,(reply>), @GohanSSJZ are they? The people from N.ireland I know consider themselves British not Irish,(reply>), You have a better Irish accent than I do and I was born in Ireland,(reply>), ‚Äã@cunnyfunt103 And study shows that a third of the people PREFER you to call them Irish, and don't want to be called British or Northern Irish. So yeah obviously the result would be mixed, but no matter what you call them, results will always be mixed. So Irish isn't incorrect, nor is British or Northern Irish, it completely depends on the person and there is no consensus. And again, we are talking about a third, with British being a bit more popular, and Northern Irish being less popular.

I‚Äôm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time, but it hasn‚Äôt caught on has it? Why on earth would a hiss like escaping steam be more effective than a peeping noise which we all recognise? Similar thinking presumably led to the replacing of the old ‚Äònee-naa‚Äô sound for police cars with the ghastly American-style wailing. By giving up the Doppler effect it made it nearly impossible to tell where the sound is coming from and if it is approaching or receding.

5 years on and trucks still make that beeping sound when reversing ...,(reply>), @Ranstone Precisely,(reply>), And crossrail still isn't open,(reply>), @Ealdy DOS isn‚Äôt bad actually. At least it‚Äôs decently compatible with things and has no Internet (so cant be hacked into externally).,(reply>), @Ealdy And thank god it's not, because when white noise alarms become mandatory, expect injuries and fatalities to skyrocket.,(reply>), Because the white noise is indistinguishable from hydraulic noises to most people.<br>The white noise reversing alarm is a failure of history yet to be acknowledged.

Honestly? It wouldn't be unnatural for advertisements to be in a sports game. Problem was the implementation. If it were in the form of banners on the stadium, like in real life, then it wouldn't be a problem here. 2K's shenanigans however are horribly wrong here if not worse than what Capcom did earlier with adding ads to SFV. Even adding them to fighters themselves (on their clothes and accessories). <br><br><br><br>If it goes for the results in general? Meh. The industry had all the time in the world to do regulate itself and actually do actual constructive stuff. But nope. They brew the bear and now they have to drink it to THE LAST DROPLET OF IT.

In order to understand the Muslim community from my western perspective I would have loved to hear a little about the role of women in different Islamic societies.,(reply>), As a Muslim I would‚Äôve loved them to touch on this topic too, because there is too much unfortunate misconceptions about women in Islam. In the Qur‚Äôan women have been given such a high status, and have been given so many rights over men too. And in practice, the prophet Muhammad‚Äôs (Peace Be Upon Him) wife Khadijah (who was a widow before) was in fact a wealthy businesswoman, and he was her employee and she fell in love with him for his sincerity and honesty and she in fact proposed to him. With regards to hijab - it simply means modesty. And men are supposed to abide by hijab as well in their dressing, whilst for men and women, the garments are different. Also on this, Maryam (Peace Be Upon Her), or Mary, whenever portrayed in images in Christianity is also seen with her hair covered, and as is the practice of nuns and also religious Jewish women who often wear wigs. It‚Äôs a shame to see so much negative light on women in Islam, and for sure, governments such as Saudi and even Taliban, are enforcing their own laws and passing it as Islam. Women are most certainly entitled and encouraged to have education in Islam, and in fact one of the greatest teachers of Islam was the Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs (PBUH) daughter Fatima. As they said in this podcast, we need to go to the sources of the information, and not be guided by the commentators. In our case, the source is the Qur‚Äôan, and the biography (Hadith) of the prophet.,(reply>), Islam has always been an advocate for women's rights, even in the past. Just look at the example of Khadijah, the first wife of Muhammad, who was a successful businesswoman and leader in her own right. Also, it's important to remember that interpretation of the Quran and Hadith can vary and may not always be perfect. Just like any religious text, it's open to interpretation and can be influenced by cultural and societal norms. It's important to keep this in mind when discussing the role of women in Islamic societies.

So every religion is the same to me.  That's why ital/halal, haram/harm.  That's just physical/chemical extraction because evolution and science is religion.  Can't carbon date stone commandments, or pyramids, or gold mormon bible.  Theoretically, 12000 years ago which matches up to some planet Mercury thing, an asteroid hit, maybe it was Pangaea, and these constants actually fluctuate.  So they Interstellard people to the pleadies, and earth was mostly destroyed.  So religion is ancient knowledge in different languages, from old English, into different languages, then back into English.  It's the translation game.  I say guru noneck.  They say I said sikh without a head.  This is how they change our language.  Wahe guru, yawe teacher.  "Jesus was a Buddhist Monk" on YouTube.  He Mulan walked on water, made a wooden arm, was resuscitated and went up north or mountain.
I like how, at the end of their interview, Strominger highlighted a possible naivety and the burden of responsibility that people like Lex need to take when "playing " with AI and how it could literally build/destroy civilisations and the human suffering that will come with it.

Isolating every old person might be hard.  We might need to concentrate them in some kind of camp to make enforcment easier (its for their own good). And obesity is also a risk factor so maybe we should lock fat people down (or up) too.  And come to think of it the unvaxinated are also much more likely to get seriously sick so why don't we lock them "down" while we're at it.  Then the rest of us can go about or lives without our liberties being infringed!  Sounds like a solution to me.

Don't worry about it. ;),(reply>), @Arc Knight_bk2o1 But they make the ads.

I did this in a jocular fashion.<br>However, if I didn't understand you then I am not to blame. For it is your job to communicate effectively. Because you cherry picked highs from one season to compare to lows in another, you lost the baseline.

I really want VR to become more mainstrem, but I personally still think headsets are way too bulky for me to want to buy one.

Whats insane is you will justify murdering the rest because of the very small amount of cases you are describing. Im ok with the .001% having an abortion if they were raped and its proven rape. If not you will just have slots and murderers claiming rape everytime.,(reply>), @sluttyMapleSyrup what does sound insane is people like you trying to justify murder.
Yes
I live in Missouri, and Josh Hawley is a scumbag of epic proportions. He only ever latches onto big, obvious, easy topics that make him look good in the papers, then works to undermine everything else. He is greasy, a liar, and a terrible politician by any metrics. So yeah, him sending this letter is meaningless and only a PR thing.
Please don't use the word Epic in relation to games.  It triggers me.

My respect for Lex has reached new heights today. I was really looking forward to this conversation since it was announced because i knew Lex would approach it, just like he does everything, with a compassionate curiosity and i am thrilled to say that he did not disappoint.

Many years from now we‚Äôll see he was absolutely correct even though two years into the pandemic many are now saying the same. The issue is all evil is paved with good intentions and thus all the lockdown scientists, modeler‚Äôs, media, politicians were myopically blind to any other solution. They only saw one solution which was save the entire population. We never did learn from the countries  who went before us. We all remember viewing the daily images in February 2020 from Spain and Italy where all the patients in ICU were 80 year olds with comorbidities. We should have realized at that time who needed to be protected.

Lex, you will never know how much your podcast means to me personally. I love your simple straight forward questions, and I love your guests. You have opened my eyes to so many interesting topics. You are a great human being and you challenge us to be better and to keep seeking. What you do matters. Thank you!!!
Yes Lex, you are naive and you project you own image on the world.,(reply>), @Random YouTube Person What kind of nasty fucker says such a thing  just because of one opinion. I know Lex is a nice MIT robot guy but to me seems a bt naive.. No one is perfect especially those who tell others to piss off,(reply>), Piss off then. Not the channel for you!

To me, it actually seemed intuitive that grain/sand/etc would lift/lower no matter if it's the screw or casing that's rotating. Simply based on relative motion, being that from the screw's perspective, the casing rotates and from the casing's perspective, the screw rotates. I only would think that the difference is in whether clockwise rotation lifts or lowers.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a religious conflict‚Äù but every single Muslim is against Israel. What a joke!,(reply>), After world war one all muslim countries were colonised by UK, France, Italy. It took a lot of fighting back before those countries were able to have independence. Thats why those muslim countries support Palestine. They understand what it means to be colonised. That‚Äôs why countries like Ireland and south Africa are the biggest supporters of Palestine, because they were under brutal occupation as well,(reply>), israel is just isis that became successful with the help of west. every single thing that you hate about isis, israel does them as well but to a much more evil level.<br><br>any one with a bit of common sense and drop of morality should hate israel (not jews). you are probably a zonist. that's why why you are portraying that Israel represents Judaism. which is absolutely false.,(reply>), Everyone who is a decent human should be against the illegal, extremist state of Israel. It is not about religion (ofc religion often gets pulled into it). Millions of non-muslims are anti-Israel

Future can be scary. it's around the corner. As long as men don't get hook or getting addicted to ChatGPT. Imagine FEMALE ROBOTS powered by CHATGPT.... I would imagine men would open store something like DIY ROBOT STORES. Build your own female robot store. I predict 100,000 men and robot hobbyist build female robot. No more gold digger. no more aging female robots, no more bad wives. no more bad females. If men cross line and marry ChatGPT females as wives. I bet crazy white females, Karens, celebrities,  super model, Female wrestlers, women will destroy and vandalize "DIY FEMALE ROBOT STORES". FEMALE APOCALYPSE could be real things. I bet women will throw a rocks on a boyfriend dating robot on public places.  Chasing men dating female robots.  Women murders men dating female robots.üò±üòÆ‚òπ men would run......Dead serious.  American will have first female president. She will sign the bill to crack down men marrying ChatGPT robot and pay fines. Wooooooah...Female John Wick kills female robots.<br><br> "Get him... destroy the female robots" taking bats and destroying most expensive robots.  This is scary future. it's around the corner. Youtube shows lots of angry female can't find men to marry because men got addicted to CHATGPT.  imagine, women storms and shut down CHATGPT technology.  Men would cry....üò≠ not joking.... women would say come over her big baby. I'm sorry we destory your female robots.<br><br>Future can be scary.... don't know what women do to men.... it can be real than science fiction.it's around the corner.

I think the part that really fascinated me was the point made about the reduced dust.  In a normal screw elevator there are grind points where the material is trying to fall back down to the previous space,  on start up even if you have enough material to fill the screw you will have some that leads the rest, some that can fall back.  If you set the screw anything other than vertical you'll have pockets of product in each thread of the screw, leaving large air pockets and making a point for the product to impact other product... all creating dust....<br><br>In this the only real grind point is all the way at the bottom.  the scoops are the largest source of friction against the product, keeping most of the dust in the stuff all the way at the bottom.<br><br>It really is absolutely brilliant,(reply>), Well said.
Lex, I love your interviews. Algorithm brought me when you interviewed Elon.  I subscribed without expecting to listen again, but to give you a like.  Glad to hear you do the same. - and here I am listening.  3 things I wish you elaborated on AND hope you do more if interviewing FB, other google or Twitter engineers.<br><br><br><br>#1.  Cristos doesn't say directly, but points out that we have an ethical responsibility to avoid "clickbait".  Youtube profits from advertising, so it has incentive to put more clickbait out there, not less.  It is up to us to stop it. Just like you said about Telsa drivers.  We are youtube drivers and owe it to the algorithm and other users to stop clicking on clickbait. <br><br><br><br>#2. when Jack Dorsey asked what Elon would do to improve Twitter, Elon responded to differentiate between real and fake users.  To differentiate real versus fake input to the algorithm.  Many have said that if they eliminated fake users, FB, Twitter, etc would lose large parts of their traffic.  Since they bill advertisers for traffic, they have no incentive to do so.  How do you fix it when economic incentive to platforms is to make it worse?<br><br><br>#3. Youtube likes large users, not small ones.  They demonetized small creators and continue to promote large users, even if they are not something we want.  Not every one "loves youtube" as Cristos said.  Nasim Najafi Adhdam was an extreme reaction to Youtube shifting more to fewer, larger promoted channes.  Subject worthy of discussion.<br><br><br>Lex, I love your interviews and listen to them all.  Thanks for all you do.

Did you seriously just hand-wave away perchlorates?
One thing barely mentioned in this discussion is shared culture. Most of these IQ tests are administered by psychologists with at least a master's degree level education if not a PHD. I'm aware they're supposed to test how well someone can perform on a random set of questions or should I say pseudo-random set of questions. Doesn't the performance of the test takers reflect how much shared culture they have with the test administrator? Sometimes even a so called random puzzle is not really random because the chance of answering it goes up if you have a good amount of shared assumptions and mindset with the person who set the puzzle. I wonder if the reverse has been done, like have a bunch of individuals give a bunch of random questions to other individuals, and have the ones that score the least become the new IQ test administrator. I believe the highest scorers will score very low.

Not allowing side-loading, controlled user experience, freedom in sandbox model are essential for the survival of Apple and its ecosystem. Fighting for it is a justifiable action especially since Apple is one of the most important companies in existence.

first there were drones for target practice, Now there will be ai eskies. it'll happen ... lol
that haircut is borderline pompadour
Only difference is that the elevators at Tower of Terror are self-moving rather than being moved by wheels or cables when they switch shafts.
I would think that one limitation might be increased danger, with an unprotected cylinder spinning in a factory setting other moving machines/people would need to be more separate, possibly increasing the space requirement for each tube. Otherwise, cool innovation.
This guy makes things that I dont mind interesting üßêü§î
Wouldn't it be woth opening and discovering its function, so we can progress in development of batteries and "learn from our predecessors"?
I have indeed stopped buying AAA games recently.  Fallout 4 was my step back from Bethesda, as the same fucking engine was used from fallout 3, years later, though I do really want the next Elder Scrolls game, assuming it's not using Skyrims engine of course.  CoD BO4 was probably my last CoD, I'd been out since BO1, and heard of PC optimization that would blow away all previous iterations, yeah that didn't happen at all, just as big of an unoptimized pile of hot garbage as they always are, nice cash grab.  I'm not a sports guy but EA has been leading this business model of releasing the same shit in yearly increments for decades with sports games.  I refuse to play Red Dead 2 online, and it will forever remain a purely single player experience to me, although I do feel like the story and single player alone was worth the price tag, at least so long as you weren't suckered into one of the more expensive options.  I feel like the only company not going down this quality toilet is Nintendo.  Yes they are starting to add more season passes, but they are for ALL the DLC to EVER release for that title in the future, and the games generally feel finished even without the DLC (BotW, Odyssey, Smash Bros, Xenoblade 2, etc).
Absolutely loved this thought experiment. The topic is too easily dismissed as pseudo science, and too many of those who entertain the concept are ... loopy. The deserves proper scie tific consideration. Thank you, Lex.
Luxottica + Facebook ?? the two most hated companies collaborating hahaha.
What if you put your hand in the "blank" spaces?
yes please, i did want to grow another finger
Finnaly the time stamps are back
You were nice enough before, time to go for the throat. I love this lmao
Dude.....who told you...,(reply>), Joe did
Linus, love all your shit, but man the people talking in the background of every single vid from this channel makes this unwatchable for me. If they're gonna talk, have them on screen and mic'd up so I can actually hear what they're saying. Otherwise it's just distracting and annoying. If they have things to say I would like to hear them. I like all the LMG people. I love the LMG content but this channel I just can't sit through. I'll check in a couple months and see if it's still this bad
<b>Let's get YouTube MP3</b>
bill nye?
You should get Larry Paulson and/or Robert Harper (CMU) and/or Philip Wadler on. They'll tell you about cutting-edge computer stuff like category theory and computer proofs. For example, Paulson has written a proof of G√∂del's theorem and the 4-color problem in Isabelle, a proof language.
oh my, ive been waiting for this
Every time I hear people say renewable energy isn't practical cuz batteries or grid mechanics or whatever, all I hear is "I don't know how to think".
Must have been some good bud üòÇ eh Riley?
So basically everyone hosting techlinked now with a beard is confirmed a Dad now?
Are we going back in time?

Game two was bad in that the Nash equilibrium trivially lands solidly at no one giving up any money. There should've been some situation where a player could have at least a chance to increase their earnings by more than x by giving up x.
Noice.
There is no such thing as gravity, it's a theory, not a physical reality. Aliens are the fallen ones. Jesus Christ is about to appear in the clouds to rapture His Church.
Where does gravity come from?
"It'll still probably be wrong, but it'll be... differently wrong" üòÇ
just needed the beats
That charger is almost a Tesla coil then, right isn't that illegal.<br>What about people with peacemakers are they safe?<br>Or is 5 watt not damaging to pacemakers ?
Ayyy, I beat the odds. My install is just fine. :D
Heh, plenty of planned communities out here in AZ that have golf cart paths. Nothing as extensive as this, though, since most of the carts are owned by retired persons, generally over the age of 55.
Supposedly Bocchi (and other Aniplex titles) made a cameo appearance with Sony/Honda's Afeela Car announcement...
This is short, all the IMF talking points and cherry picked metaphors exhausted....
i‚Äôm sorry did he just pronounce Hablo like, Hablo and not Ablo, the H isn‚Äôt pronounced in Spanish, if you want it to be Hablo it would be spelled Jablo, J has the H sound in Spanish.
Gotta love those high pitches noises at the very end
Why don't you tell YouTube that your videos are in English? It's a simple click and prevents such snafus with Korean subtitles like this one.
Krugman is THE most OVER rated economist in modern time - Lex, please get ANY Austrian School economist on to present a rational version of reality (many good suggestions in the comments).. everything about Krugman's Keynesian delusion of the real world is false; and people like Krugman exist simply for the exploitation by the Leftist political establishment to harvest votes from their quite literally brainwashed sheeple followers
Only Riley is the good presenter, go away Linus,(reply>), Riley makes everyone smile,(reply>), Riley is super cool! I like Riley! Riley makes me smile!
Noise so you can't rip the audio? It's faster to download a full album.<br>And there are bands that upload full albums here, just the audio, or lyric videos.
Firefox is still the best browser out there.  RIP.
ooo mr smart guy
Checkout Discovery Bay in Hong Kong.  Only vehicles allowed are golf carts and  the buses that they have.
Nice hair James!
I went back to watch the video you took in the room with the computers and I couldn't hear it at all. I'm probably significantly younger than you are. <br><br>Though, I wasn't surprised, when I was 17 I had a hearing test done and my maximum range was only 15kHz. It's likely gone down now, I have a lot of inner and middle ear issues.
wow tech news helps me at my job, that windows 10 issue is something I was troubleshooting just today.
Everybody‚Äôs gangsta until progress bar shows 101%
i like the title
Riley, tell me how you get your hair like that
Dear Lex, I know you are a Pink Floyd  fan. Roger Waters as a future guest?<br>Thanks for your awesome podcast! Cheers.
Still don't know how they made the filter
They seemed to dance carefully around things....
I just imagine some jobs that basically need a car using a golf cart instead.<br><br>Police chasing a racer in a golf car...<br>Firefighter carrying a few buckets of water in a golf car...<br><br>List goes on and on.
