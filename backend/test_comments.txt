I'm 35 minutes in and appreciating the frank honesty and accurate discussing of data. But am waiting for the acknowledgement that the terrible fear people felt, which caused them to behave in such inhumane ways, to judge, label and distance one another, were deliberately introduced and reinforced on a DAILY BASIS by governments and their pet media outlets. We were led into fear and encouraged to distrust one another. Yes, there is certainly an innate trait in many humans, a sense of self preservation perhaps, along with the fear, which readily responded to that invitation. But governments and their media worldwide, especially in those nations led by WEF devotees, spent millions on campaigns of fear to create that awful reaction in previously open hearted people.<br>Perhaps, without the daily brainwashing-level messages of fear and doom, we might have behaved in a different way to those suffering around us.<br>This despicably negative thrust from media and leaders, with its blanket denial of any and all messages of hope, including alternative treatments, is now practically instructing citizens to not only judge those who question the narrative or choose not to take part in the medical trials, but to invite hatred and harm against them, to call for segregation, punishment and discrimination against these people. With our governments blessings, cheering it on from our TVs, while their media spread the word of hatred and fear on a daily basis.<br>Do you not see this at all?,(reply>), it boggles my mind that this isn't more obvious to others as well. it's been obvious from very early on in this whole power grab. the 'media' 'coverage' has been so obviously crafted to psychologically demoralize and render the population fearful and compliant while also dividing society to the utmost. it is so profoundly ugly and sinister that it makes me feel nauseous and the thought that the people who orchestrated this (whoever they are) will most likely get away with it makes me feel awful in ways I just cannot describe. it's caused me to revise my default trust in both the average person in society and those at the top.
I‚Äôve been wanting to try bjj for years, but I‚Äôm always anxious about doing it. I gotta just get in there already.,(reply>), I had the same when wanting to do krav maga (at a legit school - KMG). First day was nerve wrecking with zero experience in any martial art but after 4 years and some degrees further I'm so happy I did it. Want to do BJJ when all this lockdown bs is over, since the groundwork from krav maga triggered my interest.

I really didn't get the benefit of rotating the outer casing instead of the inner screw. Did I miss something here?<br>And as you said, from a physics standpoint it's exactly the same, but rotating pipefittings sound more complicated to me than a simple through hole for an axle...,(reply>), If the tube rotates, the bearings can be outside of the tube and completely separated from the bulk material. Therefore you don't have to worry about sealing them bearings again dust and particles, and you don't have to worry about getting grease or oil in the bulk material.

people want power because they dream having the freedom of choice. what they really want is agency, so a system that gives a member or employee a limited degree of agency will both be prosperous and resilient. capitalism now repeats the mistakes of communism by reducing agency for most of workers and giving too much to plutocrats. that is not freedom, it is oligarchy and eventually it will crash the entire system

"Outstanding Podcast! I like how Lex doesn't let anyone say anything and walk away without giving an explanation. @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHTgffkpeYo&amp;t=08m49s"">08:49</a>. I think stating that there are only 3 of the most evil individuals in the world is a basic statement and somewhat na√Øve. We simplify the problem when we narrow it to one individual. Those individuals would never exist without an entire ecosystem  to support them or even give them existence in the first place."

Video editing is on point. About the progress bar, still think that some little effort should be made to turn then smooth(or linear), maybe a simple weighted system that considers how big or small a file is, or maybe some 15seconds benchmark for those really big installers. if the only purpose of a PROGRESS bar was to show that work is being done, well, we already have those loading circles.

tbf trump was actually right about most things<br><br>the problem is a growing number of people are brainwashed by the media and what trump says is extremely easily to paint a narrative around to separate what was said from what was actually meant - a classic example is mexicans are rapists, did he utter those specific words? yes, was that the actual message - obviously not, considering how much trump spoke and it was 99% off the cuff it's easy for the media to paint trump anyway they wanted - and they did, and people fell for it and still do

That's true, life itself may be abundant and common in the universe, but intelligent life may be rare.  If so, it basically means the existence of humans was an astronomical fluke occurrence.  Humans on Earth are winners of the cosmic lottery! üòÜ  If this is indeed true, it is extremely sad that we as humans are squandering this gift, and are divided and are likely to destroy ourselves over petty selfishness, hubris, and greed.

HEY LEX I JUST FOUND YOU TWO OR THREE VIDEOS AGO, SO HAVEN'T EXPLORED WHO OR WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT BUT YOU ARE ASKING ALL THE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO KNOW.  I AM A  FRATERNAL TWIN, THE NUN PULLED ME FROM MY MOTHER SOBBING ENTERING KINDERGARTEN.  THAT WAS MY IMPRESSION OF SCHOOL.  I HATED EVERY MOMENT.  I WAS VERY SHY WITH LOW SELF ESTEEM SO I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THIS IDIOT SHOW CALLED EDUCATION.  IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY SEPARATED THE SMALL CLASS OF 75 OR SO INTO TWO CLASSES, I MADE THE DUMB CLASS MY BRO THE SMART.  I JUST ASSUMED FROM THAT POINT ON I WAS STUPID.  MY TWIN WENT ON TO GET A MASTERS DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY AND BECAME A PSYCHO THERAPIST .  I FLUNKED GEOMETRY AS I WAS FEARFUL OF ASKING QUESTIONS,  THEN GOT A 95 PLUS FROM A PREP SCHOOL MALE TEACHER.  MY SAT'S WERE IN THE 200'S SO TRULY  DUMB .  WHILE IN GYM CLASS WE RAIDED THE SMALL OFFICE TO LOOK UP OUR FILES IT SAID MY IQ WAS 70-75 SO EVEN DUMBER THAN I THOUGHT.  NOW FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF THE REAL WORLD  I DECIDED TO GO TO MY BROTHER'S UNIVERSITY HE A DAY STUDENT AND I A NIGHT STUDENT.  TWO OR SO YEARS IN I LOST MY STUDENT DEFERMENT VIETNAM WAR  ERA TWO YEARS ACTIVE , RETURNED TO SCHOOL FINISHING MY DEGREE IN INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT.  MY PROF. WANTED ME TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL IN BUSINESS. I HAD ENOUGH OF THE IDIOT SHOW.  NOW THE CLIMAX AND MY APOLOGIES TO ALL I USE CAP'S FOR SPEED PLUS AT 77 MY HANDS GET NUMB.  THE ENTIRE INTELLIGENCE TESTING SHOULD BE THROWN OUT ALONG WITH MY TWIN BROTHER AND HIS COHORTS.:)<br>LEX YOU STATED IT SUCCINCTLY LOVE, PEACE, EMPATHY THE KEYS TO LIFE AND SUCCESS.  I MET AN INDIVIDUAL WHO PASSED THE PILOT WRITTEN EXAM  WITH A 100 AND COULD NOT FLY THE PLANE.  I SOLOED IN 8 HRS. GOT MY PILOTS LICENSE FLEW AEROBATICS IN MY OWN PITTS BI PLANE; I.E THE AIR FORCE WOULD NOT LET ME RE UP  FOR PILOT TRAINING WITH 2 YRS. OF COLLEGE BUT MORE SO I WAS JUST STUPID. THE MILITARY HAS THEIR TESTING AS WELL AND GENERALLY PILOT TRAINING IS ENTERED VIA THE MILITARY ACADEMIES.  I BECAME A REAL ESTATE BROKER , CONCEPT DEVELOPER AND RUBBED ELBOWS WITH MILLIONAIRES, JUDGES,  AND LOW INCOME, WANTING TO GIVE BACK AND JUST HELP PEOPLE IN LIFE.  I REALIZED THROUGH SPORTS, EDUCATION , BUSINESS, LIFE IN GENERAL POLITICS OF ALL SORTS ENTERS INTO ONE'S LIFE AND CAN BE A MAJOR FACTOR IN SUCCESS AND OR FAILURE.  I GRAVITATED TO SUBSTITUTE TEACHING SPECIAL EDUCATION CHILDREN REALIZING HOW TALENTED AND UNIQUE THEY WERE; "IT'S THE ENVIRONMENT STUPID"   I LIKE TO SAY.  I ALSO TAUGHT 4 1/2 YEARS  AT MY ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH CCD/ CHRISTIAN CONFRATERNITY REALIZING HOW MUCH I LOVED TO TEACH AND HOW VALUABLE "WHAT ONE MAN CAN DO."  BUCKY FULMEISTER'S LIFE IN SONG BY JOHN DENVER.  I HAVE HAD TWO FRIENDS WITH PHOTO GRAPHIC MEMORIES WHO COULD  QUOTE LIKE A COMPUTER BUT HAD NO COMMON SENSE.  I MET BLUE COLLAR SKILLED WORKERS ; I.E. PLUMBERS , ELECTRICIANS, CARPENTERS WHO WERE GENUS'S.  TESTS ARE LIKE LABELS, COLLARS ON AN ANIMAL.   I HAVE A YOUNG LADY FRIEND WHO IS EXCELLENT AT TAKING TESTS, CAME FROM A BROKEN HOME, IS DISORGANIZED, DYSLEXIC, OCD AS I AM AND AT 42 A FAILURE.  I'VE BEEN A STEP FATHER TO HER FOR FOUR PLUS YEARS.  SHE IS WORKING FOR A NUCLEAR FACILITY AS A LABORER, WITH 160  COLLEGE CREDIT HOURS, NOT QUALIFIED TO BE A CERTIFIED TEACHER,  DROVE OTR TRUCKS, BUT IS STARTING UP THE LADDER TO A CAREER IN NUCLEAR, AND BUYING HER FIRST HOME. SHE OWES 70 K IN STUDENT LOANS.  MANY LIKE HER ARE IN DEBT FROM THE BANKER/ ACADEMIA INSTITUTIONS, AS "IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY."   I LEARNED BY WATCHING YOU TUBE VIDEOS, AND DISCOVERED WHILE TEACHING "THERE ARE NUMEROUS INTELLIGENCE'S"  ONE IS VISUAL WHICH I APPEAR TO BE.  BOOKS PUT ME TO SLEEP, AND I GENERALLY GO TO THE END TO SUMMARIZE IT. I READ TOO MUCH INTO THE QUESTIONS AN THERE IS ALWAYS MORE THAN ONE CORRECT ANSWER  TO ANY KNOWN.  ASK DUB EINSTEIN, WHO FLUNKED MATH, WAS BLACK BALLED , COULDN'T FIND A JOB, BASICALLY ALL HIS THEOREM'S ARE NOW DEBUNKED; IE. YES WE CAN GO FASTER THAN LIGHT, STRING THEORY, QUANTUM PHYSICS AND SO MUCH MORE.  READING HIS LIFE HE MANAGED A JOB IN A PATENT OFFICE.  COULD IT BE HE WAS A FREE MASON AND PLAGIARIZED SOME PATENTS??? HE BECAME A CHRISTIAN TO BE ACCEPTABLE, LEFT HIS TWO CHILDREN AND WIFE WHO WAS A PHD IN PHYSICS IF I AM CORRECT???

I'd like people to stop apologizing for Apple, you still don't get it. They weren't preserving the CPU or the battery! They were slowing down everyone's phone so to force sales of new phones. THAT'S IT. Apple is a predatory company run by horrible people. Those suicide nets are still up at Foxconn at all twelve factories in China. You who justify Apple remind me of the soft language people who call it sexual assault when really it's rape.
HE SAID IT. HE SAID THE FORBIDDEN WORD THAT HE SWORN NOT TO. HE BECAME VERY THING HE SWORE TO DESYROY
What Mathew meant to say is "please send us some information so we can charge you with felony cheese pizza crimes." I'd also avoid sending information to NCMEC. I wouldn't send any information to any law enforcement. Law enforcement can't generally be trusted, and between plea bargains, charge stacking, and parallel construction, they'll easily slap you with a long felony record without a day in prison. Being "helpful" won't save you from an opportunistic officer using you as a career stairstep. Also, consider that while reporting on these things, you could also be teaching people how to access these things.

Digital or otherwise. Also isn't that the point of any company in existence? To make a profit? You say that like it's a dirty thing. Would you work for free?,(reply>), @TalesOfWar As i said If its their store they should control it properly. They only care about profit.,(reply>), @Hetsu Epic had and still have control over it being on the store or not, by following the rules. They broke those rules, rules they agreed to in a legally binding contract. Even the judge in the case said as much. It's only Epic and their insistence on continuing to break the rules they agreed to that are keeping it off the store. Not that this has ANY FUCKING RELEVANCE to the topic at hand. That changes absolutely nothing with regard to what the IP OWNERS allow and don't allow with things being sold by third parties. As is usually the case around here. People are quick to judge because a company they don't like is involved rather than look at the bigger fucking picture.,(reply>), @TalesOfWar Yet apple can pull shit off their store whenever they want like fortnut. If its their store they should control it properly.

I just programmed a progress bar for a computation program, and I actually made it update less often on purpose. This is because having a thread constantly checking percentage done is not worth all the extra overhead. Or in other words, the progress bar actually slows done the program by quite a lot.
"Just give us the freakin GPUs..." üî´üò°
I don't get you guys, GameStop actually had a great idea because bots can't buy up all the graphics cards at a local store. They should make a deal with manufacturers that ship them to sell in person as a I'm not a robot test.
Extremely educated, but lacking wisdom.

i hate this fucking clickbait
And still i wonder if Tom Scott is 20 years old or 50.
The greatest and most realistic  movie about AI is Collosus: Forbin Project. Came out 50 years ago.
These podcasts are very educational!
Not surprised apple would do that a certified apple  wireless charger is like over 100 bucks vs 20 for a wire and wall plug
You can try polishing up your scratched disk, or even sanding it with super fine sandpaper to get rid of the big scratches
Tom Scott, only youtuber not talking about life on Venus today :-)
On one project, customer was very set to make smooth, accurate and with "modern animations" progress bar. It took almost 90% of time and resources (I had to split one progress bar thru few threads and wait for calculations from this threads, so progress bar is slowing down whole application). And still it's accuracy is only a little bit more, than many, many "smoothing" tricks. It wasn't worth the time, but experience from designing and coding that was something priceless.
So, Tom Scott was in Poland, If I know I would ask him out for a friendly tea cup.
who's listening to this in 2020?
Did I just watch an add of Linus cheating on his wife with Pulseway?
Are movies judged like this too or they actually want to enjoy those and let us be miserable with games?
Brilliant....
You may want to protect yourself. If this is true, I wouldn't be surprised if someone in the upper class would have you picked up for having CP on your computer. Document everything.

Anyone else feel like Lex's skepticism toward government (American) is tuned a little too high?

Windows 11 system requirements are just moronic..  let the user run the OS on whatever hardware they want and if it runs or does not run as intended it's on the user .. not Microsoft.. so they need to chill the f out and actually let anyone running windows 10 to upgrade to 11.. however currently I think 10 is actually better than 11

red engine was main problem. sadly it was to WEAK for game big like this. Witcher 3 use litelary 120% power of this engine... and cyberpounkt need 200%. and ofcorse they try sell this on old console which is damm stupid.
Imagine making internet streaming services but end up just recreating cable anyways

I've read that those turbines use more fuel to make, than they give back.,(reply>), Incorrect. Wind turbines cover their costs of manufacture and installation in well under one year.

No wonder the screen dosen't break. She is using a hard rubber hammer. Those hammers spread the point of impact over a larger area which greatly reduses fragile surfaces to break under impact.

Very disappointing that Imam mentioned  the events only as one side aggression.<br>But there is a reason why the police use the skunk water. There is a reason why the army has no choise but to go into the territories in order to protect the citizens.<br>Any country will do the same!<br>It's also disappointing that the suggestion was only to talk to the Palestinians, what about the Israelis? Those people get rockets from their neighbors.
consequentially what would be the difference today between private and government power.

david tennant doing tech news?
Doesn‚Äôt it make you laugh how she quickly calls out UAP sightings/Aliens on earth and claims theres no evidence, this is the main problem with science, she‚Äôs clearly closed minded  to the documented facts, not all intelligent beings need a ‚Äúplanet‚Äù, I believe we live a multidimensional realm, one that other beings we can‚Äôt comprehend yet can travel between while we can‚Äôt.
Outstanding video with a veteran in the field!!!!!!!
While standing on a small sandstone ledge out in the desert it cracked, gave way and it and I went sliding down a hill.  At the bottom I turned it over and saw the inverted tracks of either a large bird or other kind of critter that took a liesurely stroll along a long gone sandy shore.

Hey James, loving the size of that smart watch. What is it?
Very interesting how they try to break the game right away.  The point of the game is there is no trust except the trust you earn throughout the game.  The winner can be everyone but that would be a task in futility and then the idea of winning more should influence the excitement of the game.<br><br>Whatever<br> I'm here for it. I love this and want so much more. Definitely needs strangers goin at it.  So good

Tom: I feel like I'm going straight. <br>Narrator: he was <i>not</i> going straight.
I find it funny that the playerbase of shooters is full of whiny masochists.<br><br>What i mean is, their preferred games and companies can abuse the playerbase however they see fit, because the company knows youll still buy the game or participate in playing it. Youll still buy the mtx, the season/battle passes, etc regardless of how much you may whine and moan on twitter or their forums.<br><br>Its pathetic and hilarious at the same time.
Is Tom burning out? It's a cool video, but lately I've noticed a shift from straightforward videos to more meta, like "I was going to do this, but I couldn't because it turned out that..."
Never mind the bell, are you aware that Youtube are unsubscribing people from various channels including your? I've had to resub to about 20 channels now since wedsnesday!

Why do you think all digital consoles are the norm now? One word answer: control. <br><br>Why should you own a physical copy of a game that you choose when and how to play when you can buy an always online game(halo infinite, division 2, Destiny 2) where you are forced to play certain actives and if your internet sucks. Oh well. <br><br>Physical media especially video games are going down the toilet. Digital is absolutely crap. Yet it gonna be the only way to play games 10 years from now.

the fusion announcement is <i>way</i> overblown; while this is a meaningful development in the technology, only qplasma &gt;1.0 was achieved, not qtotal. the qtotal is what needs to be &gt;1.0 in order to actually produce energy and not just be an important step towards energy, not to mention that it actually has to be <i>far</i> higher than 1.0 in order for us to be able to extract enough energy from the reaction and convert it to usable electricity, since a large portion of the reaction energy is lost during conversion (usually steam turbines, though other more efficient methods are being investigated). this news has made its way across the entire internet getting people all worked up for limitless clean energy within a decade and that is simply not happening. fusion research is very important, even critical - but it is also much, much further out than most want to admit.
If anyone wants to know what number they should put down to have the highest expected value in game 1, the answer is you should put your vote as close as possible to the total number of other votes. Meaning if everyone else does 1 each, you should put down 4, to have a 50% chance of winning. If everyone else put down 2, you should put 8 etc etc. If this is intuitive or not I'm not sure.
